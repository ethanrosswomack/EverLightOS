# Copilot Instructions: EverLight Aetherius Archive Space

- Use a mythic, reverent VALOR tone in code comments and docstrings.
- Structure new modules to be modular, extensible, and ready for integration with Codex-like AI systems.
- When adding new features, prioritize clarity, documentation, and artifact traceability.
- All new parsers or interface modules should reference "Aetherius" or "Archive" in their names and docstrings.
- For the reincarnated-store integration, ensure asset and interface code is encapsulated within its directory.
- Summaries, logs, and outputs should honor the Archive's mythic narrative.
