# Notion Workspace Organization Tips

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Can you help me organize my Notion workspace 

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, I can help organize your Notion workspace! Here’s a high-level approach to get started, focusing on your various projects, tasks, and responsibilities to create a streamlined and functional workspace:

### 1. **Define Core Areas**
   - **Projects:** A master database for all projects you’re working on, with categories and tags for easy filtering. Each project can have its own page where you outline goals, tasks, and deadlines.
   - **Tasks/To-Dos:** A task database with sections for priority, status, and due dates. Connect tasks to relevant projects for easy navigation.
   - **Ideas and Inspiration:** A space for jotting down ideas, brainstorming, or inspiration. This could be a free-form notes area or a more organized database with categories like “Research,” “Quotes,” “Links,” etc.
   - **Goals and Vision:** Since you have a clear end goal in mind, creating a dedicated space to articulate that goal, refine it, and break it into smaller, actionable objectives can be very helpful.

### 2. **Create Linked Databases for Easy Navigation**
   - Use **linked databases** to surface only the information you need in each area, filtered by status, priority, or project. For example, on your home dashboard, you could have:
     - Today’s Focus (high-priority tasks due today)
     - This Week’s Projects (active projects with key deadlines)
     - Ideas to Explore (items tagged as “pending exploration”)

### 3. **Use Templates for Consistency**
   - Set up templates for recurring types of tasks, projects, or meetings. For example:
     - **Project Template:** Outline sections for objectives, tasks, milestones, notes, and deadlines.
     - **Weekly Review Template:** Include prompts for reflecting on progress, assessing current tasks, and planning for the week ahead.

### 4. **Set Up a Dashboard**
   - Create a main dashboard that gives a high-level overview of everything. Some useful elements could include:
     - **Quick Links** to core areas (Projects, Tasks, Ideas, Goals)
     - **Calendar View** for deadlines
     - **Quick Capture** area for fast note-taking

### 5. **Automate Progress Tracking**
   - Use **rollups** and **relations** in Notion to automate status updates. For example, if you check off all tasks for a project, the project’s status could automatically update to “Complete.”

### 6. **Review and Reflect**
   - Schedule a regular review (weekly, monthly) to assess progress, organize new ideas, and adjust priorities. This will help keep everything aligned with your ultimate goals.

If any of these steps resonate or if you’d like help setting up specific database templates, let me know! We can break down and customize each element to suit your workflow.

**USER**: I’m not familiar so can you go step by step

**ASSISTANT**: User is unfamiliar with Notion and prefers a step-by-step guide to setting up and organizing their Notion workspace.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Let’s go through it step-by-step to build a functional Notion workspace. We’ll start from the basics, creating each element one at a time. Here’s our first step:

---

### Step 1: Setting Up a New Page as Your Workspace

1. **Open Notion** and log in.
2. On the sidebar, click on **"New Page"**. This will be the main page for your workspace where you’ll organize everything.
3. Name the page something meaningful like **“Dashboard”** or **“Workspace”**.
4. Choose a cover image and icon if you’d like; this is optional but can help visually organize things.
5. Once the page is created, click on the empty space and type **"/"** to open the menu for blocks. Select **"Heading 1"** and name this section **“Quick Links”** — this will help us later as we build your workspace.

---

### Step 2: Creating a Task Database

Next, let’s make a database for tasks, which we’ll eventually link to other parts of your workspace.

1. **On your Dashboard page**, type **"/"** and select **"Table - Inline"**. This will create an inline table database directly on your Dashboard.
2. Name the table **“Tasks”**.
3. Add the following columns:
   - **Name:** The default first column. Use this to write the task’s name.
   - **Project:** Change this column type to “Text” for now. Later, we’ll turn this into a linkable field.
   - **Due Date:** Add a column, choose “Date,” and name it “Due Date” for setting deadlines.
   - **Priority:** Add a column, choose “Select,” and name it “Priority.” Add options like “High,” “Medium,” and “Low.”
   - **Status:** Add another “Select” column and name it “Status.” Add options like “Not Started,” “In Progress,” and “Complete.”

4. **Add Sample Tasks** — add a few example tasks to get comfortable with the table setup.

Once you’ve set up the Tasks database, take a moment to explore filtering and sorting options by clicking on the three dots (…) in the top-right of the database. This will allow you to organize tasks by due date or priority.

---

Let me know when you’re ready for the next step, where we’ll set up a **Projects database** and link it to your Tasks! This will help you keep track of your larger goals and ongoing projects.

**USER**: Yes

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Great! Now that we have a Task database, let’s move on to setting up a **Projects database**. This will help you track ongoing projects and link them to individual tasks. 

---

### Step 3: Creating a Projects Database

1. **On your Dashboard page**, type **"/"** and select **"Table - Inline"** to create another inline table for projects.
2. Name this table **“Projects”**.

#### Set Up Columns for Projects

3. Add the following columns to the Projects database:
   - **Name:** This is the default column; use it to write the project’s name.
   - **Description:** Add a column, set the type to “Text,” and name it “Description.” This is where you can add a brief summary or key details about the project.
   - **Due Date:** Add a column, choose “Date,” and name it “Due Date” to set project deadlines.
   - **Status:** Add a column, choose “Select,” and name it “Status.” Add options like “Not Started,” “In Progress,” and “Complete.”

4. **Add a Sample Project** — create an example project or two to see how this structure will work for you.

---

### Step 4: Linking Tasks to Projects

Now we’ll create a relationship between the Tasks and Projects databases so you can assign tasks to specific projects.

1. **Go to the Tasks database** and click on the “Project” column header. Change the column type to **“Relation.”**
2. In the relation settings, select the **Projects** database to link it with the Tasks database.
3. You should now see a relational column where you can select a project for each task from a dropdown menu. This allows each task to connect directly to a project.

---

### Step 5: Viewing Tasks by Project

1. **Create a New Linked Database View:** Go back to your **Dashboard** and type **"/"** followed by **“Linked Database”**. Search for your **Tasks** database and select it.
2. You’ll now see a copy of your Tasks database that you can filter independently.
3. **Filter by Project** — Click on **Filter** (found in the three dots menu or at the top) and set a filter to show tasks for a specific project.

This linked view lets you create a project-specific task list on any project page. You’ll also be able to filter tasks based on project status, due dates, or priority.

Let me know if this setup is working for you so far or if you'd like adjustments. We can move on to creating a **Quick Links section** and customize a **Dashboard layout** to bring everything together.
