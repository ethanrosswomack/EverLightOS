00:00:30] I'm good [00:00:28 - 00:00:35] I love all of the art [00:00:30 - 00:00:37] that's why I love to do visuals yes and [00:00:35 - 00:00:40] I have like my sculptures and other good [00:00:37 - 00:00:42] things like that but I'm also very used [00:00:40 - 00:00:45] to when it's audio only I can describe [00:00:42 - 00:00:47] things that that way people that are [00:00:45 - 00:00:49] just hearing know what's going on [00:00:47 - 00:00:51] um I'm working my way towards starting [00:00:49 - 00:00:53] to to do these actually live like live [00:00:51 - 00:00:55] streams um I know this one's not going [00:00:53 - 00:00:56] to be live but I'm working my way [00:00:55 - 00:01:00] towards [00:00:56 - 00:01:02] um set up on my end for all of that uh [00:01:00 - 00:01:04] however I can post the video to [00:01:02 - 00:01:07] everything except for Spotify I was [00:01:04 - 00:01:10] always saying so that will be Audio Only [00:01:07 - 00:01:11] but um where everyone listen on on [00:01:10 - 00:01:13] Spotify [00:01:11 - 00:01:15] um hey you should definitely go check [00:01:13 - 00:01:17] out the video so you can see this [00:01:15 - 00:01:19] artwork that she has behind here because [00:01:17 - 00:01:22] it's uh it's the first thing that caught [00:01:19 - 00:01:22] my eye like wow [00:01:23 - 00:01:29] um you know I've I've followed you on on [00:01:26 - 00:01:32] Facebook got another profile [00:01:29 - 00:01:34] I deleted that profile and somehow we [00:01:32 - 00:01:37] wound up not being friends and I I heard [00:01:34 - 00:01:41] you on the uh the truth Seeker yeah and [00:01:37 - 00:01:42] um the subject material of that drew me [00:01:41 - 00:01:45] in [00:01:42 - 00:01:47] um because of my own my own story of [00:01:45 - 00:01:49] being here in Incarnation [00:01:47 - 00:01:51] um and I just really connected with that [00:01:49 - 00:01:54] and the more I listened to watch like [00:01:51 - 00:01:59] why can I get you on my podcast [00:01:54 - 00:02:03] um and the title of this is uh [00:01:59 - 00:02:05] gonna be moving how to move swiftly yeah [00:02:03 - 00:02:07] without haste through life because I've [00:02:05 - 00:02:10] noticed over the past [00:02:07 - 00:02:12] two months for me everything has really [00:02:10 - 00:02:16] slowed down but I've been accomplishing [00:02:12 - 00:02:18] a lot more and within me [00:02:16 - 00:02:18] um [00:02:18 - 00:02:23] let's just call it the holy spirit for [00:02:20 - 00:02:26] uh [00:02:23 - 00:02:29] assuming that's because you're moving [00:02:26 - 00:02:31] swifter through time but time seems to [00:02:29 - 00:02:33] have slowed down for you because you're [00:02:31 - 00:02:35] moving at a faster pace and in that [00:02:33 - 00:02:38] you're able to accomplish more because [00:02:35 - 00:02:40] you're focused more stuff and like with [00:02:38 - 00:02:42] your art you've accomplished a lot there [00:02:40 - 00:02:44] and I see your posts tonight you posted [00:02:42 - 00:02:45] um very recently [00:02:44 - 00:02:47] um [00:02:45 - 00:02:50] I think it looks like a memory of this [00:02:47 - 00:02:52] this project I I forget exactly what it [00:02:50 - 00:02:53] was called but it's like this is the [00:02:52 - 00:02:55] beginning of the birth of a new [00:02:53 - 00:02:57] dimension yeah and I was like wow that's [00:02:55 - 00:02:58] so intricate and it required a lot of [00:02:57 - 00:03:00] work [00:02:58 - 00:03:03] um so what can you what can you share [00:03:00 - 00:03:04] with them my listeners about about your [00:03:03 - 00:03:05] work [00:03:04 - 00:03:07] um if they're not familiar with the [00:03:05 - 00:03:09] truth I've had a truth seek on my [00:03:07 - 00:03:11] podcast I don't know if they caught you [00:03:09 - 00:03:15] on his but I'm I'm very intrigued [00:03:11 - 00:03:17] personally and I'm excited to [00:03:15 - 00:03:19] sit here and chat with you [00:03:17 - 00:03:21] um thank you so I'm so happy to be here [00:03:19 - 00:03:23] chatting with you thank you for reaching [00:03:21 - 00:03:26] out and initiating this and yeah there's [00:03:23 - 00:03:29] there's so much on the topic of moving [00:03:26 - 00:03:32] faster so uh okay 100 of my work is [00:03:29 - 00:03:34] based in time and I'm Aurora I'm a [00:03:32 - 00:03:37] galactic walk-in so usually I am a [00:03:34 - 00:03:40] waveform presence that I'm usually not [00:03:37 - 00:03:43] occupying or inhabiting the [00:03:40 - 00:03:45] multicellular body of what it is to be a [00:03:43 - 00:03:47] human in this realm I've been here for a [00:03:45 - 00:03:49] little over 20 years as a walk-in it's [00:03:47 - 00:03:52] been a steep learning curve [00:03:49 - 00:03:55] um one of so I know about the world of [00:03:52 - 00:03:58] pure time and that's everything that I [00:03:55 - 00:04:01] paint these Vortex shaped energy centers [00:03:58 - 00:04:03] of our body that are shaped like donuts [00:04:01 - 00:04:05] or Tauruses or Tori and now everyone is [00:04:03 - 00:04:07] super familiar with that but when I [00:04:05 - 00:04:09] first came here 20 years ago no one knew [00:04:07 - 00:04:11] what a donut Taurus was no one knew what [00:04:09 - 00:04:13] any of these shapes were and I tried to [00:04:11 - 00:04:15] tell people about flying rainbow lasagna [00:04:13 - 00:04:18] and they were definitely giving me like [00:04:15 - 00:04:20] side eye like very extremely skeptical [00:04:18 - 00:04:21] and kind of like who are you what are [00:04:20 - 00:04:23] you wearing like [00:04:21 - 00:04:24] um so this flying rainbow lasagna I'm [00:04:23 - 00:04:27] holding up my sculpture now for anyone [00:04:24 - 00:04:29] who's Audio Only it's a higher [00:04:27 - 00:04:31] dimensional tourist shape and all of [00:04:29 - 00:04:32] these are rainbow colored and I work [00:04:31 - 00:04:34] it's all rainbow colored because it [00:04:32 - 00:04:37] relates to Pure light like the [00:04:34 - 00:04:39] frequencies of light and light is also [00:04:37 - 00:04:42] connected to time and I bring this up [00:04:39 - 00:04:44] because the sense of when you change [00:04:42 - 00:04:47] your frame rate like we have a frame [00:04:44 - 00:04:49] rate of how we're perceiving reality So [00:04:47 - 00:04:52] In Motion Pictures like the movies that [00:04:49 - 00:04:54] you see uh at the movie theater it's 26 [00:04:52 - 00:04:57] frames per second and if you speed up [00:04:54 - 00:05:00] the frame rate what you end up getting [00:04:57 - 00:05:02] is a super high definition recording and [00:05:00 - 00:05:06] people experience this in their own [00:05:02 - 00:05:08] internal perception when they do [00:05:06 - 00:05:10] something to speed up and that can be [00:05:08 - 00:05:12] meditation or mindfulness sometimes it [00:05:10 - 00:05:14] can be caused by an illness sometimes it [00:05:12 - 00:05:15] can be caused by a molecule like a [00:05:14 - 00:05:18] particular molecule that people call [00:05:15 - 00:05:21] hallucinatory what it does is affect [00:05:18 - 00:05:23] biochemistry to make you perceive time [00:05:21 - 00:05:25] flowing at a different rate and then [00:05:23 - 00:05:28] what happens is you are able to get like [00:05:25 - 00:05:32] the super slow motion high definition [00:05:28 - 00:05:34] camera of reality to be able to see not [00:05:32 - 00:05:36] only kind of like the Charlie Chaplin [00:05:34 - 00:05:38] early movies a very herky-jerky [00:05:36 - 00:05:40] movements that are disconnected but [00:05:38 - 00:05:43] things that are all very smoothly [00:05:40 - 00:05:45] integumentally connected and with every [00:05:43 - 00:05:48] single detail like you not only see the [00:05:45 - 00:05:50] bird flying in its amazing motion across [00:05:48 - 00:05:52] the sky but you see every single speckle [00:05:50 - 00:05:53] on its feather and every single dewdrop [00:05:52 - 00:05:55] that's on all of the flowers that are [00:05:53 - 00:05:57] around you and so I mean I'm sure that [00:05:55 - 00:06:00] you or your audience can relate to this [00:05:57 - 00:06:02] it's a moment of being supremely present [00:06:00 - 00:06:04] like totally focused on the now totally [00:06:02 - 00:06:06] embedded in the now there's almost an [00:06:04 - 00:06:08] intimidation Factor because everything [00:06:06 - 00:06:09] is so much like I can hear that [00:06:08 - 00:06:12] butterfly flapping over there I can [00:06:09 - 00:06:14] smell that guy over there like you know [00:06:12 - 00:06:17] a lot you know even more maybe than what [00:06:14 - 00:06:19] is really necessary and my whole entire [00:06:17 - 00:06:22] Journey here has been about let's say [00:06:19 - 00:06:25] informing Humanity as humanity is [00:06:22 - 00:06:27] Awakening about the true nature of time [00:06:25 - 00:06:30] that time is this [00:06:27 - 00:06:32] um non-perceived yet thing that affects [00:06:30 - 00:06:34] us very much it's the clear medium [00:06:32 - 00:06:36] through which we swim just like if a [00:06:34 - 00:06:38] fish is swimming through a lake or a [00:06:36 - 00:06:41] pond it's perfectly clear like they are [00:06:38 - 00:06:43] might not even be aware of the substance [00:06:41 - 00:06:45] or the medium through which they are [00:06:43 - 00:06:48] transiting but time is this ever present [00:06:45 - 00:06:52] it's a supernatural Miracle it is [00:06:48 - 00:06:54] inexplicable and it is also alive it's [00:06:52 - 00:06:57] something that is upheld and not is [00:06:54 - 00:07:00] non-random not only in the events that [00:06:57 - 00:07:02] we experience but in the sentience that [00:07:00 - 00:07:04] it contains so time is its whole own [00:07:02 - 00:07:06] medium I know I'm laying like just a lot [00:07:04 - 00:07:09] of heavy stuff just right out in the [00:07:06 - 00:07:11] beginning not not I love it good I'm [00:07:09 - 00:07:15] doing a total data dump [00:07:11 - 00:07:17] um and I'm also very talented [00:07:15 - 00:07:18] the podcast out there but I wanted to [00:07:17 - 00:07:20] talk with you you know I hopped on your [00:07:18 - 00:07:24] live that day and I was like yes yes I [00:07:20 - 00:07:27] need more of this so beautiful [00:07:24 - 00:07:30] um yeah that we are becoming more aware [00:07:27 - 00:07:32] of time itself and then becoming aware [00:07:30 - 00:07:35] of it and being able to consciously [00:07:32 - 00:07:37] influence it not just swim through it [00:07:35 - 00:07:40] and the analogy that I often use for [00:07:37 - 00:07:42] that is like salmon swim upstream [00:07:40 - 00:07:43] they're not at the mercy of the stream [00:07:42 - 00:07:45] like the time stream and if you get [00:07:43 - 00:07:48] enough salmon together they're wiggling [00:07:45 - 00:07:50] waggling type of you know Locomotion [00:07:48 - 00:07:52] actually changes the currents of rivers [00:07:50 - 00:07:54] it actually changes in direct time [00:07:52 - 00:07:56] itself this is the analogy for what [00:07:54 - 00:07:58] humanity is experiencing and I point to [00:07:56 - 00:07:59] this painting that's behind me and I [00:07:58 - 00:08:01] have it on the wall behind me for a [00:07:59 - 00:08:03] reason like so that when I'm in these [00:08:01 - 00:08:05] videos I can talk about this it's called [00:08:03 - 00:08:07] birth of the flying rainbow lasagna it's [00:08:05 - 00:08:10] part of this birth of birthing of a new [00:08:07 - 00:08:13] dimension that humans and Consciousness [00:08:10 - 00:08:16] that is formerly has been submerged in [00:08:13 - 00:08:19] time kind of like tumbling to end over [00:08:16 - 00:08:20] end kind of being swirled around not [00:08:19 - 00:08:23] really being [00:08:20 - 00:08:26] um empowered and self-directed are now [00:08:23 - 00:08:28] becoming aware of time and aware of [00:08:26 - 00:08:30] consciously participating and [00:08:28 - 00:08:33] co-creating events in time realities in [00:08:30 - 00:08:34] time and even like the health and [00:08:33 - 00:08:35] vitality of your body like what your [00:08:34 - 00:08:37] body is shaped like and what you can do [00:08:35 - 00:08:41] with your body all of these are time [00:08:37 - 00:08:43] events and it moves Beyond victimhood or [00:08:41 - 00:08:45] a sense of deter determinism instead of [00:08:43 - 00:08:47] victimhood I could say like like um like [00:08:45 - 00:08:49] I'm holding up my hands like it ain't my [00:08:47 - 00:08:50] fault blame somebody else um that was [00:08:49 - 00:08:53] all written in the book beforehand you [00:08:50 - 00:08:56] know and that relates to DNA which is a [00:08:53 - 00:08:59] lot of what my work is focused on that [00:08:56 - 00:09:01] DNA for a long time people looked at it [00:08:59 - 00:09:03] and they said if something is written in [00:09:01 - 00:09:05] your DNA it's just going to happen to [00:09:03 - 00:09:07] you like a bad disease or tendency [00:09:05 - 00:09:08] that's in your family like alcoholism or [00:09:07 - 00:09:10] something like that but it doesn't have [00:09:08 - 00:09:12] to happen to you now scientists [00:09:10 - 00:09:14] recognize that there is something called [00:09:12 - 00:09:17] epigenetics what that really means is [00:09:14 - 00:09:20] there's a code that rules the code [00:09:17 - 00:09:23] things are not merely determined or [00:09:20 - 00:09:25] fated to happen to you so DNA is a [00:09:23 - 00:09:28] bridge that is a bridge of light and a [00:09:25 - 00:09:30] bridge of time in your own body and that [00:09:28 - 00:09:32] it makes it very personal like you are [00:09:30 - 00:09:34] personally connected to time it's not [00:09:32 - 00:09:36] just an abstraction and literally your [00:09:34 - 00:09:38] thoughts and your feelings your levels [00:09:36 - 00:09:41] of consciousness and what you're [00:09:38 - 00:09:43] intending to align with transforms the [00:09:41 - 00:09:44] behavior and the dance of your DNA which [00:09:43 - 00:09:47] is not a static object but it's [00:09:44 - 00:09:50] constantly oscillating and kind of like [00:09:47 - 00:09:53] gushes you like propels you through time [00:09:50 - 00:09:55] into new and interesting directions and [00:09:53 - 00:09:56] this is what is happening right now like [00:09:55 - 00:09:59] I said I've been here for about 20 years [00:09:56 - 00:10:02] and it's all been accelerating and [00:09:59 - 00:10:05] coming to this Crescendo in the musical [00:10:02 - 00:10:07] Symphony like I use that song A day in [00:10:05 - 00:10:09] life from the Beatles almost everyone [00:10:07 - 00:10:11] knows that song and at the end it kind [00:10:09 - 00:10:11] of goes like [00:10:12 - 00:10:16] and we're heading up to that moment in [00:10:15 - 00:10:18] event [00:10:16 - 00:10:20] so if you've been feeling like a Time [00:10:18 - 00:10:23] acceleration or if you've been feeling [00:10:20 - 00:10:27] an increase in Bliss which is just like [00:10:23 - 00:10:29] the frictionless existence state where [00:10:27 - 00:10:31] you flow effortlessly from one moment to [00:10:29 - 00:10:34] the next moment or from one feeling [00:10:31 - 00:10:36] state or event or behavior to the next [00:10:34 - 00:10:38] event or behavior like that's not just [00:10:36 - 00:10:40] you and that's a very positive symptom [00:10:38 - 00:10:42] of I point to that painting the whole [00:10:40 - 00:10:45] entire planet this is what people call [00:10:42 - 00:10:48] Planetary Ascension it is a leveling up [00:10:45 - 00:10:49] of everyone who's here not just humans [00:10:48 - 00:10:54] like I have a little dog who's in her [00:10:49 - 00:10:57] dog bed involves all animals insect life [00:10:54 - 00:11:00] plants our entire ecosystem everything [00:10:57 - 00:11:02] begins to move at this faster rate so [00:11:00 - 00:11:05] that I know this is like a super long [00:11:02 - 00:11:08] intro to who and what I am so I'm a [00:11:05 - 00:11:10] walk-in and I am here as part of let's [00:11:08 - 00:11:13] say planetary protector and planetary [00:11:10 - 00:11:16] Guardian really DNA Guardian so that [00:11:13 - 00:11:19] Humanity can go through this process [00:11:16 - 00:11:21] even amidst what I would call like [00:11:19 - 00:11:22] criminal circumstances like what is [00:11:21 - 00:11:24] happening right now like just like if [00:11:22 - 00:11:25] you were a little child and you were [00:11:24 - 00:11:28] growing up like you're supposed to have [00:11:25 - 00:11:31] like your baby blankie and your nice [00:11:28 - 00:11:32] crib and your toys and all the good [00:11:31 - 00:11:34] stuff and books to help you learn how to [00:11:32 - 00:11:35] read but what if you're growing up [00:11:34 - 00:11:37] someplace war-torn like whatever [00:11:35 - 00:11:40] wherever there is the current War of the [00:11:37 - 00:11:43] day and instead like don't have a real [00:11:40 - 00:11:45] crib you don't have real toys you're not [00:11:43 - 00:11:47] learning your ABCs in one two threes and [00:11:45 - 00:11:48] basically you know you don't know if you [00:11:47 - 00:11:50] have enough food you're just trying to [00:11:48 - 00:11:52] stay alive that is Humanity right now [00:11:50 - 00:11:55] and I come from this higher Galactic [00:11:52 - 00:11:58] level of really civilized Consciousness [00:11:55 - 00:12:00] that is totally loving totally based in [00:11:58 - 00:12:02] unity Consciousness totally [00:12:00 - 00:12:04] christ-centered and when I use that word [00:12:02 - 00:12:06] I'm really being non-denominational and [00:12:04 - 00:12:08] not about Earthly religion totally about [00:12:06 - 00:12:10] that Devotion to that level of [00:12:08 - 00:12:12] Consciousness and and when I or we at [00:12:10 - 00:12:15] that level look at what's going on here [00:12:12 - 00:12:17] in this war-torn world we're like those [00:12:15 - 00:12:19] are um like Souls that are trying to [00:12:17 - 00:12:22] ascend like like babies trying to [00:12:19 - 00:12:25] develop like vulnerable young [00:12:22 - 00:12:27] consciousnesses that are trying to go in [00:12:25 - 00:12:28] the right direction and then we see all [00:12:27 - 00:12:31] of these things that are happening that [00:12:28 - 00:12:32] are totally unjust that I'm like that is [00:12:31 - 00:12:34] not right that's not supposed to be [00:12:32 - 00:12:37] happening because you should be able to [00:12:34 - 00:12:39] or allowed to you should be free you [00:12:37 - 00:12:43] should be free period you should be free [00:12:39 - 00:12:45] to explore this level of Transcendence [00:12:43 - 00:12:48] in your Consciousness without having to [00:12:45 - 00:12:49] like block out this and hold off this [00:12:48 - 00:12:51] and protect myself from this and shield [00:12:49 - 00:12:53] myself from this like Ascension is [00:12:51 - 00:12:55] really supposed to be this amazing like [00:12:53 - 00:12:57] the way that a flower unfolds like you [00:12:55 - 00:12:59] don't have to have resistance and you [00:12:57 - 00:13:01] can do this beautiful opening up to God [00:12:59 - 00:13:03] and to highest Consciousness and to be [00:13:01 - 00:13:06] like Universe like I'm open like lay it [00:13:03 - 00:13:08] on me but instead we have all these [00:13:06 - 00:13:11] things that are technological [00:13:08 - 00:13:13] um Inhibitors of Consciousness or things [00:13:11 - 00:13:16] that are frequency waves that are not [00:13:13 - 00:13:18] natural frequency waves that are giving [00:13:16 - 00:13:21] a confusing or erroneous signal to our [00:13:18 - 00:13:24] body harming your trajectory through [00:13:21 - 00:13:26] time and that isn't even just about this [00:13:24 - 00:13:28] group of nascent Souls like this group [00:13:26 - 00:13:32] trying to achieve liftoff when you harm [00:13:28 - 00:13:34] time that has unreverative effects kind [00:13:32 - 00:13:37] of like on the ripples of a pond that go [00:13:34 - 00:13:40] outward into parallel Dimensions other [00:13:37 - 00:13:43] levels of reality Futures and pasts and [00:13:40 - 00:13:44] it becomes a very very big big crime so [00:13:43 - 00:13:47] please think of yourself and everyone [00:13:44 - 00:13:49] who's here listening as coming of age in [00:13:47 - 00:13:53] a very war-torn [00:13:49 - 00:13:55] um criminally unjust system where you [00:13:53 - 00:13:58] are trying to cultivate your own [00:13:55 - 00:13:59] Consciousness in Freedom and there are [00:13:58 - 00:14:01] so many different factors that are [00:13:59 - 00:14:03] stacked up against there so basically [00:14:01 - 00:14:05] all the work that I do is meant to be [00:14:03 - 00:14:07] holding the door open for Humanity's [00:14:05 - 00:14:09] Freedom giving you the option to choose [00:14:07 - 00:14:12] for yourself I offer options and [00:14:09 - 00:14:14] Consciousness like Pathways but I never [00:14:12 - 00:14:15] force you to take those Pathways and in [00:14:14 - 00:14:18] every single way this represents the [00:14:15 - 00:14:21] value system of true highest Galactic [00:14:18 - 00:14:23] Society where everything has to be based [00:14:21 - 00:14:27] in total honesty total authenticity [00:14:23 - 00:14:30] total consent that you can't lie to [00:14:27 - 00:14:33] someone or fake it or wear a fake mask [00:14:30 - 00:14:35] and say like I'm really this and then [00:14:33 - 00:14:36] later on after they commit after the [00:14:35 - 00:14:38] marriage then you take it off like no [00:14:36 - 00:14:39] I'm actually a horrible person and now [00:14:38 - 00:14:40] you're committed and you're never [00:14:39 - 00:14:43] getting out of it [00:14:40 - 00:14:45] um nothing nothing of truth can be built [00:14:43 - 00:14:47] on such a rotten foundation so yeah I'm [00:14:45 - 00:14:48] here as a representative of that and you [00:14:47 - 00:14:50] mentioned the artwork that's everything [00:14:48 - 00:14:52] that I do so I've been doing visual [00:14:50 - 00:14:56] artwork for a very long time like maybe [00:14:52 - 00:14:59] the past 18 years or so and then I also [00:14:56 - 00:15:02] do auditory artwork in it's all harmonic [00:14:59 - 00:15:05] so I also got into music and then I also [00:15:02 - 00:15:07] do a lot with dance and [00:15:05 - 00:15:10] um body cultivation because that's [00:15:07 - 00:15:13] really the ultimate uh the instrument of [00:15:10 - 00:15:15] your body and your own DNA being able to [00:15:13 - 00:15:17] do this flying rainbow lasagna dance [00:15:15 - 00:15:19] that is a higher dimensional oscillation [00:15:17 - 00:15:21] so it's even Beyond like the movement of [00:15:19 - 00:15:24] your elbows and your knees it is really [00:15:21 - 00:15:27] an oscillation of your DNA so that [00:15:24 - 00:15:29] you're singing this song or vibrating in [00:15:27 - 00:15:30] this new way that is totally [00:15:29 - 00:15:33] transformative and it's never been done [00:15:30 - 00:15:36] before and part of it part of the [00:15:33 - 00:15:37] strength is the unpredictable nature of [00:15:36 - 00:15:39] what it is so that way it's like [00:15:37 - 00:15:41] unhackable like if like if you don't [00:15:39 - 00:15:42] know exactly what's going to happen you [00:15:41 - 00:15:45] can't prevent it or have packet or [00:15:42 - 00:15:48] exploited so I teach it and exemplify it [00:15:45 - 00:15:52] to others inviting others to [00:15:48 - 00:15:54] um uh explore and generate their own [00:15:52 - 00:15:56] unpredictability nature like their own [00:15:54 - 00:15:59] random number generator press the big [00:15:56 - 00:16:02] red button generate something new and [00:15:59 - 00:16:05] see what pops out and there's a lot of [00:16:02 - 00:16:06] divinity in all of that in the new [00:16:05 - 00:16:08] unexplored patterns that are [00:16:06 - 00:16:10] harmonically integrated that come up [00:16:08 - 00:16:12] like you're a musician and I really [00:16:10 - 00:16:13] appreciate the work that you've done [00:16:12 - 00:16:15] that you've released under Hawkeye and [00:16:13 - 00:16:17] you know what it's like like when you [00:16:15 - 00:16:18] are collaborating like sometimes things [00:16:17 - 00:16:19] happen in the moment when you're like oh [00:16:18 - 00:16:21] I didn't mean for that to happen but [00:16:19 - 00:16:23] that happened that sounded good or [00:16:21 - 00:16:25] you're bouncing off of someone else this [00:16:23 - 00:16:28] is like musical collaboration on a [00:16:25 - 00:16:29] galactic scale between all of these [00:16:28 - 00:16:31] different consciousnesses all these [00:16:29 - 00:16:34] different organisms the organisms and [00:16:31 - 00:16:36] the ecosystem of Earth you're like one [00:16:34 - 00:16:38] player in a very very large Symphony Of [00:16:36 - 00:16:40] Consciousness and when I talk about all [00:16:38 - 00:16:42] that then it's like sign me up this [00:16:40 - 00:16:44] sounds awesome because that's like the [00:16:42 - 00:16:46] brochure of everything that is supposed [00:16:44 - 00:16:47] to be going on but then when your soul [00:16:46 - 00:16:50] actually gets here then you're like [00:16:47 - 00:16:51] Aurora I have complaints like please [00:16:50 - 00:16:53] call the cosmic complaints department [00:16:51 - 00:16:54] because this is not what they said it [00:16:53 - 00:16:57] was going to be like in the brochure and [00:16:54 - 00:16:59] we are both laughing knowingly yeah we [00:16:57 - 00:17:02] know we won't know [00:16:59 - 00:17:05] um you know you said that we were kind [00:17:02 - 00:17:06] of birthed or incarnated into this war [00:17:05 - 00:17:08] zone [00:17:06 - 00:17:12] um in this in inside of this war zone [00:17:08 - 00:17:13] we're kind of uh thrown into the throne [00:17:12 - 00:17:14] out of think with with what time [00:17:13 - 00:17:17] actually is and I think what's happening [00:17:14 - 00:17:21] with me as I'm getting back in sync with [00:17:17 - 00:17:23] with the actual organic uh timeline if [00:17:21 - 00:17:26] you would if you will amidst this world [00:17:23 - 00:17:27] filled with haste and all of the hate [00:17:26 - 00:17:29] that you know you got to pay your bill [00:17:27 - 00:17:30] on time you got to go to work at this [00:17:29 - 00:17:32] time you got to do this and this and [00:17:30 - 00:17:34] this and Russian Russian rush so that [00:17:32 - 00:17:36] you can never have time to think or [00:17:34 - 00:17:41] breathe [00:17:36 - 00:17:43] or do anything uh other than just Panic [00:17:41 - 00:17:45] inside your mind all the time um and [00:17:43 - 00:17:49] that's what I mean by I'm now moving [00:17:45 - 00:17:53] swiftly yeah without haste and and in [00:17:49 - 00:17:56] that I used a different terminology but [00:17:53 - 00:17:59] mine's very similar you get into what I [00:17:56 - 00:18:01] term as the uh [00:17:59 - 00:18:05] I determined as the serenity Flow State [00:18:01 - 00:18:08] of existence um just to myself and uh [00:18:05 - 00:18:10] you hit on that and just to tie this in [00:18:08 - 00:18:11] for everybody else's listening I have a [00:18:10 - 00:18:14] book here [00:18:11 - 00:18:15] in this book everybody that can see it's [00:18:14 - 00:18:18] called the courage to change everything [00:18:15 - 00:18:21] again from truth Seekers podcast the guy [00:18:18 - 00:18:24] that wrote it and Foster the first [00:18:21 - 00:18:29] podcast I ever listened to [00:18:24 - 00:18:29] um this guy was on it he was Sharon [00:18:29 - 00:18:33] how to cultivate that courage to change [00:18:31 - 00:18:36] everything and and it just really spoke [00:18:33 - 00:18:39] to me and afterwards [00:18:36 - 00:18:42] three fully formed ideas dropped into my [00:18:39 - 00:18:44] head that's omniversal media [00:18:42 - 00:18:47] the beneath the surface podcast and also [00:18:44 - 00:18:49] a um novel series titled the unveiling [00:18:47 - 00:18:50] that I'm writing [00:18:49 - 00:18:53] um [00:18:50 - 00:18:57] each and every day of the year [00:18:53 - 00:18:59] day 106 day 107 today's day 106. [00:18:57 - 00:19:01] um I have not read it yet so let's just [00:18:59 - 00:19:04] see what it says here just tie [00:19:01 - 00:19:05] everything in great [00:19:04 - 00:19:07] hmm [00:19:05 - 00:19:10] just encouraging you [00:19:07 - 00:19:12] it says it is curious that physical [00:19:10 - 00:19:15] courage should be so common in the world [00:19:12 - 00:19:17] and moral courage so rare a quote from [00:19:15 - 00:19:19] Mark Twain [00:19:17 - 00:19:21] have you given some thought lately as to [00:19:19 - 00:19:23] who you are and what you stand for are [00:19:21 - 00:19:25] you a person of high conviction or do [00:19:23 - 00:19:26] you have double standards these are [00:19:25 - 00:19:29] questions every successful leader [00:19:26 - 00:19:31] eventually asks many people apply their [00:19:29 - 00:19:33] standards to others but neglect to use [00:19:31 - 00:19:35] the same criteria for themselves I see [00:19:33 - 00:19:37] this time and time again where a leader [00:19:35 - 00:19:39] sets one standard for their subordinates [00:19:37 - 00:19:41] and lives by another the same shows up [00:19:39 - 00:19:42] with parents who tell their children to [00:19:41 - 00:19:43] live one way while doing just the [00:19:42 - 00:19:46] opposite [00:19:43 - 00:19:49] double standards of what being out of [00:19:46 - 00:19:51] Integrity is all about how can anyone be [00:19:49 - 00:19:53] in Integrity if they don't walk their [00:19:51 - 00:19:56] talk now this is not an easy thing to do [00:19:53 - 00:19:58] always but it's not about being perfect [00:19:56 - 00:20:00] it's about setting a standard and doing [00:19:58 - 00:20:02] your best to live up to it if you get [00:20:00 - 00:20:04] off track then reset the standard and [00:20:02 - 00:20:06] start over again and again until it [00:20:04 - 00:20:08] becomes a part of who you are this is [00:20:06 - 00:20:10] the way to build a successful and [00:20:08 - 00:20:12] filling life which is beaming with [00:20:10 - 00:20:14] lasting friendships wealth health and [00:20:12 - 00:20:17] happiness [00:20:14 - 00:20:19] and [00:20:17 - 00:20:21] they they want to effects of the year [00:20:19 - 00:20:25] 2023. [00:20:21 - 00:20:28] I'm talking about who who we really are [00:20:25 - 00:20:30] um and we authentically bear ourselves [00:20:28 - 00:20:32] are we going to get caught up in the [00:20:30 - 00:20:34] haste of life and and wear that mask you [00:20:32 - 00:20:36] know that we have to present to the [00:20:34 - 00:20:38] world that we've been trained to think [00:20:36 - 00:20:40] that we are because if so then we're [00:20:38 - 00:20:41] going to be I think there's a verse in [00:20:40 - 00:20:43] the Bible that says that I'm something [00:20:41 - 00:20:45] about being double-minded [00:20:43 - 00:20:47] um and uh [00:20:45 - 00:20:50] trying to hold on to two opposing [00:20:47 - 00:20:52] Concepts you know you can't [00:20:50 - 00:20:56] there's so many verses in there that [00:20:52 - 00:21:00] that say basically the same thing and [00:20:56 - 00:21:02] how do we become authentic in our [00:21:00 - 00:21:05] in our beingness here on Earth how do we [00:21:02 - 00:21:06] uh come to the realization where our [00:21:05 - 00:21:10] brain is able to process [00:21:06 - 00:21:13] um the fact that that we're not just [00:21:10 - 00:21:16] um whoever is on our government ID card [00:21:13 - 00:21:19] that we're so much more or that that you [00:21:16 - 00:21:22] know our our soul aspect or the the the [00:21:19 - 00:21:24] life within us the identity within [00:21:22 - 00:21:25] beneath the surface how do we get to the [00:21:24 - 00:21:27] point where we're comfortable enough [00:21:25 - 00:21:29] with ourselves to tell ourselves that [00:21:27 - 00:21:31] truth and to really walk and live in [00:21:29 - 00:21:34] that because [00:21:31 - 00:21:37] my name is Ethan Womack according to the [00:21:34 - 00:21:40] thing but the name Within Me is Hawkeye [00:21:37 - 00:21:42] and has to do with the eye of a hawk and [00:21:40 - 00:21:45] having the vision of that and you speak [00:21:42 - 00:21:48] of this being a war zone and My Soul [00:21:45 - 00:21:51] Essence incarnates into different star [00:21:48 - 00:21:54] systems when Wars get out of [00:21:51 - 00:21:56] alignment things go too far and I come [00:21:54 - 00:21:59] to end the wars why because of that [00:21:56 - 00:21:59] ripple effect that it has bowl of the [00:21:59 - 00:22:02] system [00:21:59 - 00:22:05] and I know that about myself uh the [00:22:02 - 00:22:07] official title there if I was to make it [00:22:05 - 00:22:10] up in English would be Hawkeye [00:22:07 - 00:22:12] the ancient star Walker [00:22:10 - 00:22:13] War Lord of Light [00:22:12 - 00:22:15] yeah [00:22:13 - 00:22:16] and the thing is that I don't come into [00:22:15 - 00:22:20] fight I come to say the fight has [00:22:16 - 00:22:22] already ended and [00:22:20 - 00:22:26] the reason behind that is because of [00:22:22 - 00:22:28] what's at stake on the grander scale not [00:22:26 - 00:22:30] just Universal but omniversal because [00:22:28 - 00:22:33] these things Ripple out as you said but [00:22:30 - 00:22:34] that's a very difficult thing for [00:22:33 - 00:22:37] um somebody [00:22:34 - 00:22:39] raised in America oh their name is this [00:22:37 - 00:22:41] go to school this is now you dropped out [00:22:39 - 00:22:43] of school well now you gotta do this and [00:22:41 - 00:22:45] that and great music but go to work so [00:22:43 - 00:22:48] you can pick your bill it's fairly hard [00:22:45 - 00:22:50] to be authentic and true with myself [00:22:48 - 00:22:52] especially if I'm not going to make time [00:22:50 - 00:22:56] to do my podcast [00:22:52 - 00:22:59] to write my music to go on tour like I'm [00:22:56 - 00:23:01] going to do in the fall good for you [00:22:59 - 00:23:04] to um [00:23:01 - 00:23:07] interact and connect with with other [00:23:04 - 00:23:09] people who have had deeper realizations [00:23:07 - 00:23:11] of self and they kind of [00:23:09 - 00:23:13] I don't I don't even like to say that [00:23:11 - 00:23:15] they've disconnected from consensus [00:23:13 - 00:23:19] reality I like to think that they'd [00:23:15 - 00:23:22] rather reconnected with actuality and um [00:23:19 - 00:23:24] you know that the words that you speak [00:23:22 - 00:23:25] and all of what you've said thus far and [00:23:24 - 00:23:28] everything else that I've seen you put [00:23:25 - 00:23:32] out just speaks volumes to me I'm like [00:23:28 - 00:23:34] that's someone who remembers [00:23:32 - 00:23:36] totally it might be because I'm a [00:23:34 - 00:23:37] walk-in that I didn't do like the [00:23:36 - 00:23:40] Amnesia wipe that people get when they [00:23:37 - 00:23:43] are birthed but I came in to this [00:23:40 - 00:23:45] physical vessel remembering everything [00:23:43 - 00:23:47] about what it's like in the place where [00:23:45 - 00:23:49] I am outside of time space and [00:23:47 - 00:23:52] dimensionality and I also vibrate there [00:23:49 - 00:23:54] all the time so for me being here for 20 [00:23:52 - 00:23:56] years it hasn't been like cut off from [00:23:54 - 00:24:00] that level of knowingness for 20 years [00:23:56 - 00:24:02] like I literally cohabitate at that [00:24:00 - 00:24:04] level and that I also feel like that's [00:24:02 - 00:24:05] like like when you're able to get out to [00:24:04 - 00:24:07] the grocery store and everyone else like [00:24:05 - 00:24:09] can't quite get out like I will get out [00:24:07 - 00:24:11] I will get avocados I will bring them [00:24:09 - 00:24:14] back and I will give them to you so that [00:24:11 - 00:24:15] that's a lot of what I do I get inspire [00:24:14 - 00:24:18] people to for them to remember [00:24:15 - 00:24:21] themselves like I come from a time place [00:24:18 - 00:24:24] where like death is not a thing and I [00:24:21 - 00:24:26] also come from a time place where lying [00:24:24 - 00:24:30] is not a thing like when you activate [00:24:26 - 00:24:32] this highest self aperture this chakra [00:24:30 - 00:24:35] on the body that is Christ consciousness [00:24:32 - 00:24:37] business you can see everything like you [00:24:35 - 00:24:39] can read a person like a book you can [00:24:37 - 00:24:42] see everything that they've done as a [00:24:39 - 00:24:44] soul up into this moment and radiating [00:24:42 - 00:24:46] forward and it's also it's not done out [00:24:44 - 00:24:47] of judgment it's all done out of love so [00:24:46 - 00:24:49] you can see like yeah like that was a [00:24:47 - 00:24:51] mistake and that was the thing you did [00:24:49 - 00:24:52] wrong but then you also see here's where [00:24:51 - 00:24:53] you fixed it and here's where you [00:24:52 - 00:24:55] learned and here's where you picked [00:24:53 - 00:24:58] yourself up so it's perceiving the [00:24:55 - 00:25:01] totality of a person but like lies or [00:24:58 - 00:25:03] lack of Integrity simply do not exist at [00:25:01 - 00:25:04] that level of reality a lie is like you [00:25:03 - 00:25:06] know when you see a little kid like [00:25:04 - 00:25:08] pulls their hoodie over their head and [00:25:06 - 00:25:10] they're like ah you can't see me it's [00:25:08 - 00:25:12] like no like you can't see me but I can [00:25:10 - 00:25:15] see you very easily so the sense that [00:25:12 - 00:25:18] we're here in this world now now where [00:25:15 - 00:25:20] there are lots of lies and I I remember [00:25:18 - 00:25:22] like crushingly the first moment I was [00:25:20 - 00:25:24] exposed to a lie when I first came here [00:25:22 - 00:25:26] as Aurora and you guys might have had [00:25:24 - 00:25:28] that experience in early childhood like [00:25:26 - 00:25:30] three or four years old or whatever it [00:25:28 - 00:25:31] was here my dog has arrived from the for [00:25:30 - 00:25:35] the video she's right down here there we [00:25:31 - 00:25:36] go that's Master teacher cheeky yeah but [00:25:35 - 00:25:37] you might have remembered like maybe [00:25:36 - 00:25:39] someone told you like you'll get a [00:25:37 - 00:25:40] lollipop or whatever something will [00:25:39 - 00:25:42] happen and then it didn't happen to [00:25:40 - 00:25:45] three years old and you're like [00:25:42 - 00:25:48] they lied their actions didn't match [00:25:45 - 00:25:50] their words and that causes like a [00:25:48 - 00:25:52] crushing inside that realization because [00:25:50 - 00:25:54] I think all of us have this Angelic [00:25:52 - 00:25:56] Heritage like I said I think I'm here to [00:25:54 - 00:25:58] remind you of where you really came from [00:25:56 - 00:26:00] and who you really are but you all know [00:25:58 - 00:26:02] that lies are not how we're supposed to [00:26:00 - 00:26:04] do things and that speaks to that [00:26:02 - 00:26:06] reading that you gave us inspirationally [00:26:04 - 00:26:07] um from the daily book [00:26:06 - 00:26:11] to be able to say what is integrity [00:26:07 - 00:26:13] Integrity is when your actions match [00:26:11 - 00:26:14] your intentions and sometimes you set a [00:26:13 - 00:26:16] high bar and then you're like you don't [00:26:14 - 00:26:18] like you're like I never eat sugar but [00:26:16 - 00:26:19] then like you find yourself eating sugar [00:26:18 - 00:26:20] you're like okay most of the time I [00:26:19 - 00:26:22] always never [00:26:20 - 00:26:24] um but you try not to and you do better [00:26:22 - 00:26:26] but that's very very different than if [00:26:24 - 00:26:28] you tell someone I will give you a [00:26:26 - 00:26:30] lollipop and then it's an over lie and [00:26:28 - 00:26:33] there's no lollipop because that is a [00:26:30 - 00:26:35] type of erroneous information and [00:26:33 - 00:26:38] everything that I am aligned with and [00:26:35 - 00:26:42] that I support and uphold and not fight [00:26:38 - 00:26:44] for but you know like um battle for the [00:26:42 - 00:26:46] sovereignty of it's all about being [00:26:44 - 00:26:49] alignment with Divine truth and this [00:26:46 - 00:26:52] perfect Cosmic architecture and when I [00:26:49 - 00:26:53] paint my paintings they're non-arbitrary [00:26:52 - 00:26:55] that you know you can make lots of [00:26:53 - 00:26:57] things that are very pretty patterns and [00:26:55 - 00:26:58] that's not what my stuff is even though [00:26:57 - 00:27:00] I love decorative art and I want to [00:26:58 - 00:27:02] encourage people endlessly like make [00:27:00 - 00:27:03] decorative art explore yourself you [00:27:02 - 00:27:06] don't not everything has to be like [00:27:03 - 00:27:08] perfectly calibrated Cosmic truth is my [00:27:06 - 00:27:09] job because I'm also big on just like [00:27:08 - 00:27:11] respecting everybody's uniqueness and [00:27:09 - 00:27:13] and um where you're going in your life [00:27:11 - 00:27:15] but I came here with a very unique [00:27:13 - 00:27:17] mission where I'm like okay I have to [00:27:15 - 00:27:19] represent this Cosmic truth so I have a [00:27:17 - 00:27:20] high standard for me to be able to make [00:27:19 - 00:27:22] sure that everything is calibrated [00:27:20 - 00:27:24] correctly and I make it you know with [00:27:22 - 00:27:27] two within like whatever a tiny a tiny [00:27:24 - 00:27:29] Micron pen as as small as I can make it [00:27:27 - 00:27:31] for the purposes of being able to [00:27:29 - 00:27:34] conform to this mathematical almost [00:27:31 - 00:27:37] Divine abstract truth and when I share [00:27:34 - 00:27:39] that then I feel like it is like a a [00:27:37 - 00:27:42] seed Crystal that is dropped into a [00:27:39 - 00:27:44] supersaturated solution that then it's a [00:27:42 - 00:27:46] a reference point of truthfulness that [00:27:44 - 00:27:48] then all of these other things can [00:27:46 - 00:27:51] cluster around and be based upon as a [00:27:48 - 00:27:55] foundation of Truth and that that's what [00:27:51 - 00:27:57] this Integrity is it's uh the Divine [00:27:55 - 00:27:59] thoughts the Divine Mind Of God like a [00:27:57 - 00:28:01] very very very much larger [00:27:59 - 00:28:02] um Consciousness level that I always say [00:28:01 - 00:28:05] this to and everything that I share [00:28:02 - 00:28:09] spoiler alert it's you like when we talk [00:28:05 - 00:28:10] about about the sun and the stars and [00:28:09 - 00:28:12] the network of light and God [00:28:10 - 00:28:14] Consciousness it's always like you think [00:28:12 - 00:28:17] like it's so big it's so Grand and scale [00:28:14 - 00:28:19] it's so up there out there but spoiler [00:28:17 - 00:28:21] they're it's you and it's really those [00:28:19 - 00:28:24] stars are you looking at down at your [00:28:21 - 00:28:26] mortal self here and God is really you [00:28:24 - 00:28:29] as like this super evolved incredibly [00:28:26 - 00:28:30] wise version of you after having been [00:28:29 - 00:28:32] through so many experiences of [00:28:30 - 00:28:34] refinement and then also like not [00:28:32 - 00:28:36] abandoning yourself but really like kind [00:28:34 - 00:28:38] of reaching back through time or like [00:28:36 - 00:28:40] sticking your hand down into the fish [00:28:38 - 00:28:43] tank and being like this is going to [00:28:40 - 00:28:46] need a nudge in the right direction [00:28:43 - 00:28:48] nudge and [00:28:46 - 00:28:52] um the to be a part of that perfect [00:28:48 - 00:28:53] Continuum of time events and that's also [00:28:52 - 00:28:56] what you were talking about in your own [00:28:53 - 00:29:00] personal life trying to be respectful [00:28:56 - 00:29:02] and in alignment with the natural time [00:29:00 - 00:29:06] events that we want to be a part of as [00:29:02 - 00:29:08] opposed to the secular and human created [00:29:06 - 00:29:11] often erroneous time events of what time [00:29:08 - 00:29:13] is something happening on the TV do I [00:29:11 - 00:29:15] have to be at work at a certain time is [00:29:13 - 00:29:17] a bill or a tax thing have to be paid at [00:29:15 - 00:29:19] a certain time all of that is very [00:29:17 - 00:29:21] artificial time and our true time is the [00:29:19 - 00:29:23] time that it's like about the seasons of [00:29:21 - 00:29:25] nature what you feel like doing in the [00:29:23 - 00:29:27] morning like you know like when I first [00:29:25 - 00:29:28] get up in the morning I feel like yeah [00:29:27 - 00:29:30] like it's time for me to make music and [00:29:28 - 00:29:32] then like [00:29:30 - 00:29:34] usually like whatever 11 30 p.m I'm [00:29:32 - 00:29:35] usually like yeah like I'm tired like it [00:29:34 - 00:29:38] doesn't feel like time to make music to [00:29:35 - 00:29:39] me like you you have a natural Rhythm [00:29:38 - 00:29:41] some people yeah they're different than [00:29:39 - 00:29:42] me but or like doing a workout I'm like [00:29:41 - 00:29:45] get up in the morning do the workout [00:29:42 - 00:29:47] first thing and go at 11 30 PM I'm like [00:29:45 - 00:29:49] my muscles are tired and I don't really [00:29:47 - 00:29:52] feel like doing a workout right now like [00:29:49 - 00:29:55] there are natural patterns of time that [00:29:52 - 00:29:57] would be our natural scheduler if we [00:29:55 - 00:30:00] were in a pristine world and if we were [00:29:57 - 00:30:02] not domesticated and it's not bad to be [00:30:00 - 00:30:04] domesticated like my dog is a beautiful [00:30:02 - 00:30:05] domesticated dog she's a Chihuahua she's [00:30:04 - 00:30:09] not a wild wolf she doesn't run around [00:30:05 - 00:30:10] you know eating deer in um a public like [00:30:09 - 00:30:11] a wild park somewhere or something like [00:30:10 - 00:30:14] that [00:30:11 - 00:30:16] um but being domesticated as a human is [00:30:14 - 00:30:18] very different than our wild form in [00:30:16 - 00:30:21] terms of being a feral Consciousness [00:30:18 - 00:30:22] that when we are Pharaoh like we don't [00:30:21 - 00:30:25] work for money we don't sell our time [00:30:22 - 00:30:27] for money we do what we need to do from [00:30:25 - 00:30:29] moment to moment because kind of like [00:30:27 - 00:30:31] you know like Fu to anything that wants [00:30:29 - 00:30:33] me to do so something that is not [00:30:31 - 00:30:36] divinely ordained like we follow that [00:30:33 - 00:30:38] Divine ordinance throughout everything [00:30:36 - 00:30:40] and nothing can take us off that path [00:30:38 - 00:30:42] and that is literally how you live [00:30:40 - 00:30:45] forever so live forever is not just like [00:30:42 - 00:30:47] take a convenient Elixir something like [00:30:45 - 00:30:50] you drink it once live forever means you [00:30:47 - 00:30:52] choose to do certain behaviors and dance [00:30:50 - 00:30:56] steps through time that you never mess [00:30:52 - 00:30:56] up and you never stop and you never can [00:30:56 - 00:30:58] um [00:30:56 - 00:31:00] compromise it to someone else like I [00:30:58 - 00:31:02] will pay you five bucks to stop doing [00:31:00 - 00:31:03] your perfect Divine dance through time [00:31:02 - 00:31:06] you're like no it's totally not worth it [00:31:03 - 00:31:08] it's not worth it in any way and you [00:31:06 - 00:31:10] know they put us in in these these traps [00:31:08 - 00:31:12] I don't think they are but it doesn't [00:31:10 - 00:31:14] matter but we could put in these traps [00:31:12 - 00:31:15] of like oh now you you have this bill [00:31:14 - 00:31:17] it's five dollars and if you don't pay [00:31:15 - 00:31:19] it you know this and that so you better [00:31:17 - 00:31:21] take their deal and stop you know and [00:31:19 - 00:31:23] it's all the same thing all over again [00:31:21 - 00:31:25] and it's catching you up in that [00:31:23 - 00:31:31] itchiness of life so that you can't slow [00:31:25 - 00:31:31] down and move with the flow of uh [00:31:31 - 00:31:37] I I can look at mine at myself back on [00:31:35 - 00:31:39] my on my life and I can see different uh [00:31:37 - 00:31:41] moments in time where I would [00:31:39 - 00:31:44] intuitively [00:31:41 - 00:31:46] uh use that Hawk side view to see [00:31:44 - 00:31:48] through time and see what was coming [00:31:46 - 00:31:51] down the line and I wouldn't believe it [00:31:48 - 00:31:54] it's hard to even pay much of as much [00:31:51 - 00:31:56] attention to it until I'm focused in on [00:31:54 - 00:31:57] being myself but I can look back and I [00:31:56 - 00:31:59] have a track record of I knew this was [00:31:57 - 00:32:01] going to happen here at this point in [00:31:59 - 00:32:03] this point at this point and I even know [00:32:01 - 00:32:05] the why why so that I would be ready to [00:32:03 - 00:32:06] know okay [00:32:05 - 00:32:09] this thing that I told myself was going [00:32:06 - 00:32:11] to happen happened even though I didn't [00:32:09 - 00:32:14] really believe it and since it happened [00:32:11 - 00:32:16] I'm able to move into who I need to be [00:32:14 - 00:32:18] at this point here [00:32:16 - 00:32:22] because without [00:32:18 - 00:32:23] that I would not have um [00:32:22 - 00:32:26] accepted [00:32:23 - 00:32:30] the role that I needed to play it at [00:32:26 - 00:32:33] point B unless I saw point a before I [00:32:30 - 00:32:35] even started counting if you will and [00:32:33 - 00:32:37] it's all it's all very precise in this [00:32:35 - 00:32:40] and that and I and I see like that's the [00:32:37 - 00:32:43] flow that I need to be in so that I can [00:32:40 - 00:32:45] be in the places where my Spirit guides [00:32:43 - 00:32:48] me so that I can interact with the [00:32:45 - 00:32:50] people who need a nudge from me in the [00:32:48 - 00:32:53] physical or through my music or through [00:32:50 - 00:32:55] my art or through the conversations or [00:32:53 - 00:32:56] through the way that I can connect dots [00:32:55 - 00:32:58] between [00:32:56 - 00:33:01] this piece of art from that person over [00:32:58 - 00:33:04] there and this artist here and this [00:33:01 - 00:33:06] speaker here and draw a picture with [00:33:04 - 00:33:10] words and say don't y'all see the [00:33:06 - 00:33:13] Symmetry the the the the Synergy of life [00:33:10 - 00:33:14] how it's all these three people don't [00:33:13 - 00:33:16] know each other at all they're all [00:33:14 - 00:33:18] saying the same thing it's all [00:33:16 - 00:33:20] outlandish stuff how are they saying the [00:33:18 - 00:33:21] same stuff that's on your mind in the [00:33:20 - 00:33:24] back of your head that you're not even [00:33:21 - 00:33:25] allowing yourself to believe you know [00:33:24 - 00:33:28] and I get to I get to play that role [00:33:25 - 00:33:30] that's very important because not a lot [00:33:28 - 00:33:33] of people are doing it [00:33:30 - 00:33:37] but a lot of people need someone to [00:33:33 - 00:33:39] paint the picture if you will and um [00:33:37 - 00:33:41] it's just [00:33:39 - 00:33:44] I sometimes think that like I created [00:33:41 - 00:33:46] this whole podcast thing not only for [00:33:44 - 00:33:49] for other people that will benefit from [00:33:46 - 00:33:51] it um in a synchronistic manner but also [00:33:49 - 00:33:54] a big part of it is [00:33:51 - 00:33:57] having these conversations with with [00:33:54 - 00:34:00] Souls like you that otherwise it would [00:33:57 - 00:34:02] be some kind of um in this case world [00:34:00 - 00:34:05] that we live in it would be some kind of [00:34:02 - 00:34:07] an imposition or strange context instead [00:34:05 - 00:34:08] of um you know having having something [00:34:07 - 00:34:11] uh [00:34:08 - 00:34:14] let's just open open my discussion about [00:34:11 - 00:34:18] whatever loose loose topic that we um [00:34:14 - 00:34:19] come up with and it's really beautiful [00:34:18 - 00:34:22] to me [00:34:19 - 00:34:26] and I see even where I'm at now I see [00:34:22 - 00:34:27] where I will be at six months from now [00:34:26 - 00:34:30] um [00:34:27 - 00:34:31] yet as excited as I am just to see all [00:34:30 - 00:34:34] of that unfold [00:34:31 - 00:34:38] I notice that there is [00:34:34 - 00:34:40] a very my days are slowing down I'm [00:34:38 - 00:34:42] experiencing more of life as I'm living [00:34:40 - 00:34:46] it and I'm also very aware of how short [00:34:42 - 00:34:50] uh this human lifespan is and and [00:34:46 - 00:34:51] instead of feeling anxious and so [00:34:50 - 00:34:53] focused on these future events and"},"status":"success","warning":"STOP RIGHT HERE!

00:34:58] this and this to get [00:34:55 - 00:35:00] I'm just slowing down and I notice when [00:34:58 - 00:35:03] I go to work [00:35:00 - 00:35:07] um in the mornings I [00:35:03 - 00:35:08] I used to wake up and before I knew it I [00:35:07 - 00:35:11] was late [00:35:08 - 00:35:13] now I wake up and I think okay I've [00:35:11 - 00:35:15] waited around long enough and I got my [00:35:13 - 00:35:18] things to go out of the door I know oh [00:35:15 - 00:35:20] 25 35 minutes left out [00:35:18 - 00:35:23] my [00:35:20 - 00:35:25] my perception of time has slowed down so [00:35:23 - 00:35:27] much and I'm very grateful for it even [00:35:25 - 00:35:28] though I'm I see this in the future I'm [00:35:27 - 00:35:30] very excited to get there I'm not [00:35:28 - 00:35:31] rushing towards it [00:35:30 - 00:35:34] um [00:35:31 - 00:35:35] and to me that's [00:35:34 - 00:35:38] that's what [00:35:35 - 00:35:39] living your life is all about instead of [00:35:38 - 00:35:42] having a life [00:35:39 - 00:35:43] your life lives for you by people that [00:35:42 - 00:35:47] are pushing you around with this demand [00:35:43 - 00:35:49] and that demand and you know um [00:35:47 - 00:35:52] and how can I [00:35:49 - 00:35:55] be a part of the uh solution unless I'm [00:35:52 - 00:35:58] going to allow for uh [00:35:55 - 00:36:02] the beauty I just remember as the beauty [00:35:58 - 00:36:06] in capital letters the beauty to uh [00:36:02 - 00:36:08] solve my own riddles and problems and uh [00:36:06 - 00:36:12] beautiful yeah how can I be the solution [00:36:08 - 00:36:13] unless I am the solution you know [00:36:12 - 00:36:15] um [00:36:13 - 00:36:17] so it's [00:36:15 - 00:36:20] it's very interesting to me that you [00:36:17 - 00:36:23] because not a lot of people uh are as [00:36:20 - 00:36:25] outspoken um as you are about being a [00:36:23 - 00:36:27] walk-in [00:36:25 - 00:36:29] um yeah can you can you tell me more [00:36:27 - 00:36:31] um about [00:36:29 - 00:36:34] about that like um [00:36:31 - 00:36:36] just whatever you have to share on that [00:36:34 - 00:36:39] and thank you for asking and asking so [00:36:36 - 00:36:42] respectfully there are actually a lot of [00:36:39 - 00:36:45] walk-ins here in this time place now and [00:36:42 - 00:36:48] it's because of missions on on planetary [00:36:45 - 00:36:50] Ascension and everybody's got their own [00:36:48 - 00:36:51] unique Mission and so for some people I [00:36:50 - 00:36:54] wouldn't say it's covert but it's more [00:36:51 - 00:36:56] private like I know someone and their [00:36:54 - 00:36:58] father got in a car accident and the [00:36:56 - 00:37:01] original ego state of their father died [00:36:58 - 00:37:02] and passed on but a person walked in and [00:37:01 - 00:37:04] he ended up becoming a Healer but he [00:37:02 - 00:37:06] doesn't end up necessarily telling [00:37:04 - 00:37:09] everyone like hi I'm a walk-in he just [00:37:06 - 00:37:11] does his work so what is really [00:37:09 - 00:37:13] important to recognize and acknowledge [00:37:11 - 00:37:15] is like you know I like I joke like I'm [00:37:13 - 00:37:17] out of the closet about it but there's [00:37:15 - 00:37:20] no judgment there's no judgment at what [00:37:17 - 00:37:22] any level of sharing or [00:37:20 - 00:37:25] um disclosure people would like to do [00:37:22 - 00:37:26] about who they are and what they have [00:37:25 - 00:37:29] experienced and what they know about [00:37:26 - 00:37:32] themselves so this is just me fully [00:37:29 - 00:37:35] being authentic in my truth I came in on [00:37:32 - 00:37:37] October 8th of 2001 so it was right [00:37:35 - 00:37:39] after the events of 9 11 and the events [00:37:37 - 00:37:41] of 9 11 were totally I'm making a giant [00:37:39 - 00:37:43] tearing motion now a tearing of the [00:37:41 - 00:37:46] fabric of time space and Consciousness [00:37:43 - 00:37:48] and then also a lot of turbulence a lot [00:37:46 - 00:37:52] of time turbulence and I came in in that [00:37:48 - 00:37:54] aftermath and um that's what this flying [00:37:52 - 00:37:57] rainbow lasagna hyper Taurus or higher [00:37:54 - 00:37:59] dimensional Taurus shape is all about a [00:37:57 - 00:38:02] new genetic Dance Movement that has [00:37:59 - 00:38:04] allowed me to oscillate in here and do [00:38:02 - 00:38:05] these nudges and I love that you nudge [00:38:04 - 00:38:07] and we nudge each other we nudge each [00:38:05 - 00:38:08] other in the fish tank be like remember [00:38:07 - 00:38:11] your God remember your god [00:38:08 - 00:38:13] um so it's been a part of my [00:38:11 - 00:38:15] um Mission and purpose in being here to [00:38:13 - 00:38:17] be authentic from the beginning like I [00:38:15 - 00:38:19] knew who I was as soon as I came into [00:38:17 - 00:38:21] this body I knew what had happened to [00:38:19 - 00:38:23] the previous occupant who by the way was [00:38:21 - 00:38:25] like a good person who didn't deserve to [00:38:23 - 00:38:27] die was all very cosmically unjust and [00:38:25 - 00:38:29] that's why I came came in and took this [00:38:27 - 00:38:32] life like as a way of rectifying that [00:38:29 - 00:38:33] and I honor her soul and I honor her [00:38:32 - 00:38:36] journey but I'm very very different than [00:38:33 - 00:38:40] her and um so that's also like I was [00:38:36 - 00:38:42] very um truthful to all like friends and [00:38:40 - 00:38:44] family and relationships that the person [00:38:42 - 00:38:46] who used to have this life and this body [00:38:44 - 00:38:48] was in as soon as I came in and I'm like [00:38:46 - 00:38:50] I'm a different person this is what [00:38:48 - 00:38:52] happened and some people could not [00:38:50 - 00:38:54] accept that and it was also like there [00:38:52 - 00:38:57] was not initially a lot of acceptance [00:38:54 - 00:38:59] from her biological family now it's 20 [00:38:57 - 00:39:00] years later and I'm happy to say like I [00:38:59 - 00:39:02] held the door open we've done a lot of [00:39:00 - 00:39:04] healing of the family Dynamic and now I [00:39:02 - 00:39:06] have a very good relationship with them [00:39:04 - 00:39:08] so I say this also to anyone else who [00:39:06 - 00:39:09] might be struggling with biological [00:39:08 - 00:39:12] Family Birth family acceptance [00:39:09 - 00:39:14] acceptance of who you are especially if [00:39:12 - 00:39:16] you're non-neurotypical or if you are [00:39:14 - 00:39:18] aligning with being a starseed or a [00:39:16 - 00:39:20] walk-in or a feel otherworldly in any [00:39:18 - 00:39:23] way like it can be hard for other people [00:39:20 - 00:39:25] to know like how to at what you are an [00:39:23 - 00:39:28] undefined quantity and we do not know [00:39:25 - 00:39:29] what to do with you and just that's why [00:39:28 - 00:39:31] I was asking you to share [00:39:29 - 00:39:35] um [00:39:31 - 00:39:36] it's not everybody's job to to say hey [00:39:35 - 00:39:38] I'm this you know because their job is [00:39:36 - 00:39:40] to you know this or that but I know that [00:39:38 - 00:39:42] there's a lot of people out there that [00:39:40 - 00:39:43] feel because they contact me privately [00:39:42 - 00:39:45] they're like I know I've been following [00:39:43 - 00:39:47] your stuff this and that what do I do [00:39:45 - 00:39:51] about this and I'm like [00:39:47 - 00:39:54] if that's initially there was a lot of [00:39:51 - 00:39:57] rejection of me being Aurora and even [00:39:54 - 00:39:58] presumption of mental illness and so [00:39:57 - 00:40:00] first of all to my brothers and sisters [00:39:58 - 00:40:02] if anybody out there has mental illness [00:40:00 - 00:40:04] you are loved if you have mental illness [00:40:02 - 00:40:05] or emotional instability or whatever is [00:40:04 - 00:40:07] going on with you you are loved and [00:40:05 - 00:40:08] there's nothing wrong with that but I [00:40:07 - 00:40:09] just had to make a very clear [00:40:08 - 00:40:12] distinction that what my experience was [00:40:09 - 00:40:15] was not a psychiatric disorder but was a [00:40:12 - 00:40:17] spiritual experience and I actually [00:40:15 - 00:40:19] spent the first couple of years that I [00:40:17 - 00:40:21] was here in human form just proving that [00:40:19 - 00:40:23] to people and my artwork went a long way [00:40:21 - 00:40:26] to doing that because my artwork is very [00:40:23 - 00:40:27] organized very mathematical and I came [00:40:26 - 00:40:29] in with all of this that this is really [00:40:27 - 00:40:32] the information that I contain it's kind [00:40:29 - 00:40:34] of like woven within me and I started [00:40:32 - 00:40:36] making these very detailed drawings and [00:40:34 - 00:40:38] diagrams from the very beginning and I [00:40:36 - 00:40:40] actually have a stack of notebooks like [00:40:38 - 00:40:42] this tall of all the things that I did [00:40:40 - 00:40:43] yeah in the first early years and then I [00:40:42 - 00:40:47] started to develop them into paintings [00:40:43 - 00:40:49] and I really initially had to prove to [00:40:47 - 00:40:53] the people around you that I was very [00:40:49 - 00:40:55] grounded very orderly that all of my um [00:40:53 - 00:40:58] assertions were not self-conflictory and [00:40:55 - 00:40:59] and as I made this artwork little by [00:40:58 - 00:41:01] little people started to recognize like [00:40:59 - 00:41:04] okay like she's definitely together [00:41:01 - 00:41:06] because I I can comprehend what it is [00:41:04 - 00:41:08] like from other people's Viewpoint of [00:41:06 - 00:41:10] like I literally came here wait I'm [00:41:08 - 00:41:13] holding up now this is a walk down [00:41:10 - 00:41:15] memory lane everyone this is the [00:41:13 - 00:41:17] original flying rainbow lasagna that I [00:41:15 - 00:41:18] ever first developed like my prototype [00:41:17 - 00:41:20] that's made out of this children's you [00:41:18 - 00:41:22] know like Sculpey clay I cooked it in my [00:41:20 - 00:41:24] home oven and I made this literally you [00:41:22 - 00:41:26] know like 2003 so I had only been on [00:41:24 - 00:41:29] earth a couple of years and I used to [00:41:26 - 00:41:31] stand on the street corner in Woodstock [00:41:29 - 00:41:33] New York and just offer it to people [00:41:31 - 00:41:35] just be like I'd like to tell you about [00:41:33 - 00:41:37] this and of course everybody like gave [00:41:35 - 00:41:40] me the craziest looks you can imagine [00:41:37 - 00:41:42] they're they're like who are you what [00:41:40 - 00:41:43] are you why are you doing this and [00:41:42 - 00:41:45] because from where I come from this [00:41:43 - 00:41:47] place of total generosity where when you [00:41:45 - 00:41:49] get a great idea or inspiration or [00:41:47 - 00:41:51] whatever you just want to share it and [00:41:49 - 00:41:53] gift it with others it is your gift in [00:41:51 - 00:41:55] this world and I faced a lot of [00:41:53 - 00:41:56] skepticism and people would be like who [00:41:55 - 00:41:57] are you and I'll be like well I'm an [00:41:56 - 00:41:59] interdimensional visitor and they're [00:41:57 - 00:42:01] like you're like E.T where are you from [00:41:59 - 00:42:03] and I just say no no I'm not from a [00:42:01 - 00:42:06] coordinate like a space-time coordinate [00:42:03 - 00:42:08] I'm from a Consciousness Collective and [00:42:06 - 00:42:10] that we are non-technological and that [00:42:08 - 00:42:11] we are like a waveform like music and [00:42:10 - 00:42:13] this like already like heads were [00:42:11 - 00:42:15] exploding people really couldn't take it [00:42:13 - 00:42:16] now it's 20 years later and people are [00:42:15 - 00:42:19] much more open to this people have [00:42:16 - 00:42:21] leveled up so much that it's not so [00:42:19 - 00:42:24] difficult so I faced a lot of challenges [00:42:21 - 00:42:26] at like I I mean like I'm culturally I'm [00:42:24 - 00:42:29] an outsider and I didn't understand how [00:42:26 - 00:42:31] to navigate the world of lying greed and [00:42:29 - 00:42:34] commodification that is just what [00:42:31 - 00:42:36] everyone here thinks is normal and also [00:42:34 - 00:42:38] um I'm definitely non-neurotypical [00:42:36 - 00:42:40] because I came into this body there's [00:42:38 - 00:42:41] brain damage from what killed the [00:42:40 - 00:42:44] previous occupants so I'm [00:42:41 - 00:42:47] non-neurotypical in my perceptions and [00:42:44 - 00:42:49] my articulations now I'm very [00:42:47 - 00:42:51] particularly but I used to not be very [00:42:49 - 00:42:53] articulate extremely articulate thank [00:42:51 - 00:42:56] you because you know what I have I have [00:42:53 - 00:42:59] worked on it I really had to learn to [00:42:56 - 00:43:02] expand my vocabulary I had to practice [00:42:59 - 00:43:03] pronouncing words and saying things so [00:43:02 - 00:43:05] that they would come out the way I [00:43:03 - 00:43:08] wanted to and I focus a lot of my mental [00:43:05 - 00:43:10] energy on making my mouth connect [00:43:08 - 00:43:12] effectively to my brain because um [00:43:10 - 00:43:14] people who know me in life they know as [00:43:12 - 00:43:16] soon as I get stressed out like I don't [00:43:14 - 00:43:18] even talk anymore just like but but like [00:43:16 - 00:43:19] I don't even say full sentences um [00:43:18 - 00:43:22] that's the first thing that breaks down [00:43:19 - 00:43:24] yeah on that note um [00:43:22 - 00:43:27] I um I would like to share some some [00:43:24 - 00:43:28] lyrics of mine because they fit in with [00:43:27 - 00:43:29] the context of this and everything that [00:43:28 - 00:43:31] you were saying people talking about [00:43:29 - 00:43:33] mental illnesses and that and through [00:43:31 - 00:43:35] your art you're able to kind of prove [00:43:33 - 00:43:38] and say like no it's not that here's [00:43:35 - 00:43:39] this I mean how do I how do I articulate [00:43:38 - 00:43:41] this in a language that you can [00:43:39 - 00:43:42] understand because what I've got coming [00:43:41 - 00:43:44] through doesn't come through in English [00:43:42 - 00:43:47] and this and that [00:43:44 - 00:43:50] um me too I've been [00:43:47 - 00:43:52] since I was a child [00:43:50 - 00:43:56] um the stigma of mental illness has been [00:43:52 - 00:43:58] trying to been pushed on me by various [00:43:56 - 00:44:01] people that probably shouldn't [00:43:58 - 00:44:02] I've done that to me very unjustly but [00:44:01 - 00:44:06] it's something I've had to kind of [00:44:02 - 00:44:08] resist for most of my life until [00:44:06 - 00:44:10] um [00:44:08 - 00:44:12] at some point at some point they they [00:44:10 - 00:44:15] left me alone and it became clear that [00:44:12 - 00:44:17] okay he's not he's not insane we can't [00:44:15 - 00:44:18] play that [00:44:17 - 00:44:21] um and we're talking about being [00:44:18 - 00:44:22] articulate and having to train yourself [00:44:21 - 00:44:25] um [00:44:22 - 00:44:28] you know how to how to train your tongue [00:44:25 - 00:44:30] and so when I started writing um [00:44:28 - 00:44:32] these rap lyrics I'd [00:44:30 - 00:44:33] never written rap I was always just [00:44:32 - 00:44:35] playing the guitar [00:44:33 - 00:44:36] um other than that I had to teach myself [00:44:35 - 00:44:37] to sing and I never liked the sound of [00:44:36 - 00:44:40] my voice [00:44:37 - 00:44:42] I was writing these big long articles [00:44:40 - 00:44:46] and books on Facebook and nobody would [00:44:42 - 00:44:50] read them so I got really frustrated and [00:44:46 - 00:44:51] I that I'll just write rap and I'll [00:44:50 - 00:44:53] still say the stuff to people and it'll [00:44:51 - 00:44:55] think into their Consciousness they'll [00:44:53 - 00:44:56] probably sing along with it and really [00:44:55 - 00:44:58] like it [00:44:56 - 00:45:01] and [00:44:58 - 00:45:03] I realized I don't know how to rap and I [00:45:01 - 00:45:05] had to train I had to practice over and [00:45:03 - 00:45:07] over and over again to train my tongue [00:45:05 - 00:45:09] to be able to work to say all of these [00:45:07 - 00:45:10] words to be able to to say it in the [00:45:09 - 00:45:14] right Cadence with the Rhythm to switch [00:45:10 - 00:45:16] it up and the song then this is on my my [00:45:14 - 00:45:17] upcoming album Shadow band will be out [00:45:16 - 00:45:18] in October [00:45:17 - 00:45:21] um [00:45:18 - 00:45:23] this year right when my tour starts but [00:45:21 - 00:45:27] the title of the song is crystal clear [00:45:23 - 00:45:29] and I use a k for Crystal and K for [00:45:27 - 00:45:33] clear because I'm talking about crystals [00:45:29 - 00:45:35] and crystals and cristala but the this [00:45:33 - 00:45:36] part of the song Here said yeah there [00:45:35 - 00:45:40] you go [00:45:36 - 00:45:43] the actual Crystal for everyone I've got [00:45:40 - 00:45:47] some other uh Stones here [00:45:43 - 00:45:50] um all over the place but um it says [00:45:47 - 00:45:52] lingua and now there it's rap music so [00:45:50 - 00:45:55] there's some uh [00:45:52 - 00:45:57] a theme language in here but [00:45:55 - 00:45:58] I hope that doesn't offend you um that's [00:45:57 - 00:46:00] what I'm saying [00:45:58 - 00:46:01] with that tell anyone with small [00:46:00 - 00:46:04] children to throw them out the window [00:46:01 - 00:46:04] immediately I'm joking [00:46:06 - 00:46:11] um uh linguistical mystical script [00:46:09 - 00:46:13] that's cryptic and Mythic whenever [00:46:11 - 00:46:15] like this is written all of Heavens [00:46:13 - 00:46:17] enlisted and assisting with specific [00:46:15 - 00:46:19] information like listen did you know if [00:46:17 - 00:46:21] you're a patient of mine your new [00:46:19 - 00:46:24] prescription is wordplay competitions [00:46:21 - 00:46:27] with competent comprehensive fully [00:46:24 - 00:46:29] formed complex interesting new sentences [00:46:27 - 00:46:31] all this wicked verbage that you've [00:46:29 - 00:46:34] heard this bird come deliver isn't just [00:46:31 - 00:46:36] silly worded nonsensical lyric filler [00:46:34 - 00:46:38] because I can say what I mean however I [00:46:36 - 00:46:40] want in the language reconstructs itself [00:46:38 - 00:46:42] around the things that I thought and [00:46:40 - 00:46:45] whenever I Endeavor to say clever [00:46:42 - 00:46:48] watch how fluidly this Druid speech then [00:46:45 - 00:46:50] proceeds to concoct amazingly [00:46:48 - 00:46:53] understandable easy Concepts that flow [00:46:50 - 00:46:55] together like I've only ever been gifted [00:46:53 - 00:46:58] with Pros but I'm lying rhyming lines [00:46:55 - 00:47:00] that don't belong in making them into a [00:46:58 - 00:47:04] song how many times should I remind you [00:47:00 - 00:47:08] I'm Divine and nothing's wrong [00:47:04 - 00:47:08] so clear [00:47:08 - 00:47:14] beautiful and that's what I'm [00:47:12 - 00:47:17] with my art that's what I'm able to [00:47:14 - 00:47:20] bring through and say am I still insane [00:47:17 - 00:47:22] uh and obviously the answer is that's a [00:47:20 - 00:47:24] rhetorical question because I'm not and [00:47:22 - 00:47:25] all of the intricate stuff that you can [00:47:24 - 00:47:29] bring through there [00:47:25 - 00:47:32] it's it's really amazing isn't it how [00:47:29 - 00:47:34] again the Holy Spirit [00:47:32 - 00:47:38] and over the course of you said 20 years [00:47:34 - 00:47:41] change the fabric of the mindscape of [00:47:38 - 00:47:43] people across the planet and now they're [00:47:41 - 00:47:45] accepting of what back then they [00:47:43 - 00:47:46] couldn't accept because right when you [00:47:45 - 00:47:49] said you came in with the 911 stuff [00:47:46 - 00:47:51] right after that it was they ripped open [00:47:49 - 00:47:52] a very dark portal and it's kind of like [00:47:51 - 00:47:55] you came back in and you're like here [00:47:52 - 00:47:57] let me recalibrate it absolutely [00:47:55 - 00:48:01] absolutely I was having a conversation [00:47:57 - 00:48:04] in 2016 with someone who is a long-term [00:48:01 - 00:48:05] friend who saw my artwork and my artwork [00:48:04 - 00:48:07] like hasn't been out there that much [00:48:05 - 00:48:09] like you know I haven't had that many [00:48:07 - 00:48:12] shows or whatever but was in um my [00:48:09 - 00:48:14] living room slash studio and looked at [00:48:12 - 00:48:16] it and he was like very overwhelmed and [00:48:14 - 00:48:18] very emotionally uplifted by it this is [00:48:16 - 00:48:20] guy like maybe in his 60s or whatever [00:48:18 - 00:48:22] it's been on Earth for a while and he [00:48:20 - 00:48:24] was like like Humanity just isn't ready [00:48:22 - 00:48:27] for this it's just not ready but he was [00:48:24 - 00:48:29] like but what would it be like to be in [00:48:27 - 00:48:32] a world where humanity is ready for this [00:48:29 - 00:48:35] level of intensity of you know flat out [00:48:32 - 00:48:38] um abstract information totally and so [00:48:35 - 00:48:40] that was 2016 or so now it's 2023. I [00:48:38 - 00:48:41] think humanity is ready for it like we [00:48:40 - 00:48:42] thought that it would be 50 years this [00:48:41 - 00:48:44] guy thought that he would be long dead [00:48:42 - 00:48:46] and in the grave before Humanity would [00:48:44 - 00:48:48] level up to that point I'm seeing so [00:48:46 - 00:48:51] much acceptance celebration and thirst [00:48:48 - 00:48:54] and hunger in a positive way for this [00:48:51 - 00:48:56] the type of information that I share and [00:48:54 - 00:48:58] the in intensity of it like I do this [00:48:56 - 00:49:00] class now I teach several different type [00:48:58 - 00:49:01] of online classes and I have for a long [00:49:00 - 00:49:03] time but I have a new curriculum it's [00:49:01 - 00:49:06] called path of light and it's all about [00:49:03 - 00:49:07] like what photons and the light field is [00:49:06 - 00:49:10] really doing like what these waveforms [00:49:07 - 00:49:11] are really doing even on the level how [00:49:10 - 00:49:13] would people find your class oh yeah so [00:49:11 - 00:49:16] you can find it on my website I'm flying [00:49:13 - 00:49:18] rainbow lasagna.com and I would say you [00:49:16 - 00:49:19] should message me through there because [00:49:18 - 00:49:21] it's actually it's so new it doesn't [00:49:19 - 00:49:23] have its own little like bullet point it [00:49:21 - 00:49:25] doesn't have its own little [00:49:23 - 00:49:27] um uh theme tag underneath my courses [00:49:25 - 00:49:28] we'll be sure to put that in the [00:49:27 - 00:49:31] description I just wanted to [00:49:28 - 00:49:35] thank you really appreciate that and um [00:49:31 - 00:49:37] uh because I I my my it is my job joy to [00:49:35 - 00:49:39] receive this information from the Sun [00:49:37 - 00:49:41] and the stars and then send it out to [00:49:39 - 00:49:44] people and so I have this whole new [00:49:41 - 00:49:48] curriculum that I got from connecting my [00:49:44 - 00:49:50] tendril of awareness to the stars at [00:49:48 - 00:49:53] night having a conversation with that [00:49:50 - 00:49:55] presence of Consciousness and then this [00:49:53 - 00:49:57] abstract energy comes into me and then [00:49:55 - 00:49:59] I'm like how am I going to put this into [00:49:57 - 00:50:01] words or diagrams or pictures to be able [00:49:59 - 00:50:03] to share it with others so the point [00:50:01 - 00:50:06] that I was coming to is that I thought [00:50:03 - 00:50:07] that it was too much for Humanity I'm [00:50:06 - 00:50:09] like this is people's brains are gonna [00:50:07 - 00:50:11] liquefy and Float out through their ears [00:50:09 - 00:50:13] and and people are gonna like this is [00:50:11 - 00:50:15] too much I'm gonna fry their brains and [00:50:13 - 00:50:17] so um that was that and then of course [00:50:15 - 00:50:18] like I do sun gazing every morning and [00:50:17 - 00:50:19] one morning the sun was like you don't [00:50:18 - 00:50:22] have to be perfect like just try just [00:50:19 - 00:50:23] just try just get started on it so I've [00:50:22 - 00:50:25] taught this class [00:50:23 - 00:50:28] um two times previously like as um an [00:50:25 - 00:50:30] eight week long session and both times I [00:50:28 - 00:50:32] found found students and people that [00:50:30 - 00:50:33] were so they gravitated to the [00:50:32 - 00:50:35] information so much they were so [00:50:33 - 00:50:37] receptive to it it was not too much [00:50:35 - 00:50:39] heavy lifting it was not too [00:50:37 - 00:50:42] intimidating at all they totally took to [00:50:39 - 00:50:43] it because it's a new way of modeling [00:50:42 - 00:50:46] what light is doing instead of saying [00:50:43 - 00:50:47] that light is like bouncing off of the [00:50:46 - 00:50:49] surface of an object and bouncing into [00:50:47 - 00:50:51] my eye or that it's being emitted from a [00:50:49 - 00:50:54] star what we're really perceiving is [00:50:51 - 00:50:56] that all light is one Photon that all [00:50:54 - 00:50:58] overlaps with each other and that there [00:50:56 - 00:51:00] are these ballooning reality structures [00:50:58 - 00:51:03] that we that are time space that we [00:51:00 - 00:51:06] experience but then also we cause those [00:51:03 - 00:51:08] balloons to kind of collapse and be [00:51:06 - 00:51:10] drawn back in through the cognitive [00:51:08 - 00:51:12] event of our perception so when you [00:51:10 - 00:51:15] really look at light and the Sun and the [00:51:12 - 00:51:17] stars and time what you see is like a [00:51:15 - 00:51:19] central epicenter with all of these [00:51:17 - 00:51:21] amazing like Loops that expand but then [00:51:19 - 00:51:23] they come in and there's a rhythmic [00:51:21 - 00:51:26] expansion and contraction in all [00:51:23 - 00:51:29] dimensions and that that that's what [00:51:26 - 00:51:30] we're really living within it's it's [00:51:29 - 00:51:33] very different than the five senses [00:51:30 - 00:51:36] reality structure so yeah people are [00:51:33 - 00:51:39] totally ready for that and that that's [00:51:36 - 00:51:41] why I think these insights and forms of [00:51:39 - 00:51:43] information come to me that it's it's my [00:51:41 - 00:51:46] job I'm a Visionary artist like I have [00:51:43 - 00:51:47] an inner Vision I see it I feel it and [00:51:46 - 00:51:49] then I'm like how can I make it as the [00:51:47 - 00:51:51] thing that others can experience so yeah [00:51:49 - 00:51:53] we're there we're at that point that we [00:51:51 - 00:51:55] thought it was going to take 50 years to [00:51:53 - 00:51:58] achieve but I'm so happy everything [00:51:55 - 00:52:00] keeps on accelerating including human [00:51:58 - 00:52:02] development and all of this is like the [00:52:00 - 00:52:04] precursor or the weightlifting that you [00:52:02 - 00:52:07] do in the gym to get ready for the [00:52:04 - 00:52:07] actual Marathon like we're on we're [00:52:07 - 00:52:11] gonna go [00:52:07 - 00:52:13] it's funny you say that because tell me [00:52:11 - 00:52:16] before I got ready for this [00:52:13 - 00:52:17] um yeah this is going to sound strange [00:52:16 - 00:52:19] to people listen but what is what [00:52:17 - 00:52:22] happened spirit said you need to go work [00:52:19 - 00:52:25] out before yeah so I did and I didn't [00:52:22 - 00:52:28] know why I just did it [00:52:25 - 00:52:30] um but there's there's so much that came [00:52:28 - 00:52:30] up for you [00:52:30 - 00:52:33] [Music] [00:52:34 - 00:52:40] make it concise here [00:52:37 - 00:52:42] omniversal media beneath the surface [00:52:40 - 00:52:43] podcast and then a story called the [00:52:42 - 00:52:46] unveiling [00:52:43 - 00:52:48] um it's a fictional novel fantasy and [00:52:46 - 00:52:51] I'm still writing it the first one is [00:52:48 - 00:52:52] called First Light that's the title of [00:52:51 - 00:52:54] the first book [00:52:52 - 00:52:57] and there's a character that starts off [00:52:54 - 00:52:57] in the um [00:52:58 - 00:53:02] prologue or the little part before the [00:53:01 - 00:53:04] book starts that's in there the story [00:53:02 - 00:53:08] before the story [00:53:04 - 00:53:12] um and the character's name is halama [00:53:08 - 00:53:14] and in the mythology of the story she is [00:53:12 - 00:53:16] um what is considered one of the sun [00:53:14 - 00:53:18] speakers there's this order of sun [00:53:16 - 00:53:23] speakers and they kind of control the [00:53:18 - 00:53:26] political uh religious uh government of [00:53:23 - 00:53:29] the whole of the world and none of them [00:53:26 - 00:53:31] are real and they all this is this this [00:53:29 - 00:53:34] stuff but then the Sun starts speaking [00:53:31 - 00:53:36] she's in the Luminous halls and she's [00:53:34 - 00:53:37] hearing this voice and saying we're [00:53:36 - 00:53:39] talking to you because you're the only [00:53:37 - 00:53:41] one listening [00:53:39 - 00:53:43] she's referred to as a sun speaker and [00:53:41 - 00:53:46] you're talking about talking with the [00:53:43 - 00:53:47] sign so here we are on Omniverse media [00:53:46 - 00:53:49] is beneath the surface podcast talking [00:53:47 - 00:53:50] about my book being unveiling and you [00:53:49 - 00:53:53] you don't know any of that information [00:53:50 - 00:53:55] over here that I got in my backdrop but [00:53:53 - 00:53:57] you're talking about speaking with the [00:53:55 - 00:54:02] light codes in it I just think that's [00:53:57 - 00:54:03] beautiful so that's it later folks we'll [00:54:02 - 00:54:04] come back to that when I write the book [00:54:03 - 00:54:05] or whatever [00:54:04 - 00:54:08] um [00:54:05 - 00:54:10] the the second thing is [00:54:08 - 00:54:15] you think Humanity's ready now and we're [00:54:10 - 00:54:17] 20 23 and in 2009 [00:54:15 - 00:54:20] when I [00:54:17 - 00:54:24] the context of my spirituality in 2009 [00:54:20 - 00:54:27] was I was um in very deeply involved in [00:54:24 - 00:54:29] a Baptist Church here in Georgia [00:54:27 - 00:54:32] um so religion was the context that box [00:54:29 - 00:54:34] that I got in but God was very real to [00:54:32 - 00:54:37] me and it was very unreal to me how [00:54:34 - 00:54:40] unreal God was to all of these people [00:54:37 - 00:54:42] professing it and I was speaking with a [00:54:40 - 00:54:44] a friend there and talking about some [00:54:42 - 00:54:46] deep things and [00:54:44 - 00:54:48] I don't know if he heard me or not but I [00:54:46 - 00:54:49] heard me as we were talking about the [00:54:48 - 00:54:52] end times and all the stuff in [00:54:49 - 00:54:54] Revelation now Revelation the unveiling [00:54:52 - 00:54:57] uh all of this and that [00:54:54 - 00:54:59] I say to him because we're pondering [00:54:57 - 00:55:00] like when is what's the time frame [00:54:59 - 00:55:02] because I feel like we're in the end [00:55:00 - 00:55:04] days and I say [00:55:02 - 00:55:08] to him [00:55:04 - 00:55:10] sometime between 20 23 and 2025 that's [00:55:08 - 00:55:12] when all of this is gonna and that was [00:55:10 - 00:55:15] back then you see I told you earlier I [00:55:12 - 00:55:15] tell myself before [00:55:16 - 00:55:22] here we are again with you saying that [00:55:19 - 00:55:24] and I've got my story in the background [00:55:22 - 00:55:26] earlier I was saying you know this [00:55:24 - 00:55:28] person this person this person I can [00:55:26 - 00:55:28] connect dots and show you the picture of [00:55:28 - 00:55:30] how [00:55:28 - 00:55:33] this is [00:55:30 - 00:55:34] this isn't just some [00:55:33 - 00:55:37] I don't know maybe maybe we're tapping [00:55:34 - 00:55:39] into some insane uh Consciousness field [00:55:37 - 00:55:41] like we're just about crazy or there's [00:55:39 - 00:55:43] something real to it that there's [00:55:41 - 00:55:45] definitely something real but then we [00:55:43 - 00:55:46] also experience a lot of crazy nonsense [00:55:45 - 00:55:49] waves that's what the millimeter waves [00:55:46 - 00:55:51] are there's some I want to jump in and [00:55:49 - 00:55:52] talk a little bit about Book of [00:55:51 - 00:55:54] Revelation but I also want to talk about [00:55:52 - 00:55:55] some of some of your your own personal [00:55:54 - 00:55:57] sharing there's a movie called [00:55:55 - 00:55:59] Interstellar that's like a pretty good [00:55:57 - 00:56:01] sci-fi movie that I think it's good [00:55:59 - 00:56:03] because it gives [00:56:01 - 00:56:04] um Humanity a Common Language to talk [00:56:03 - 00:56:08] about things that are difficult to talk [00:56:04 - 00:56:10] about that the Spaceman Space traveler [00:56:08 - 00:56:12] in the movie goes through a quasar and [00:56:10 - 00:56:13] then ends up being kind of like bouncing [00:56:12 - 00:56:17] around in time you see him behind the [00:56:13 - 00:56:19] scenes in time and he ends up being the [00:56:17 - 00:56:21] influencer that he thought was some [00:56:19 - 00:56:22] otherworldly ghost he was pushing the [00:56:21 - 00:56:25] books off the bookshelf he was [00:56:22 - 00:56:27] influencing himself I take that as a [00:56:25 - 00:56:29] template to be able to say we set things [00:56:27 - 00:56:32] up for ourselves in our lives because in [00:56:29 - 00:56:35] for the most part the intellect and the [00:56:32 - 00:56:37] ego is a gatekeeper a gatekeeper to the [00:56:35 - 00:56:39] belief system of what we feel or think [00:56:37 - 00:56:42] is possible in the world and part of it [00:56:39 - 00:56:43] is rational objective materialism that [00:56:42 - 00:56:45] is things that we've been taught in [00:56:43 - 00:56:46] school or by our culture or parents or [00:56:45 - 00:56:48] something like that and part of it is [00:56:46 - 00:56:50] the collective Consciousness like the [00:56:48 - 00:56:51] reason why you don't just like jump off [00:56:50 - 00:56:53] the surface of the Earth and like [00:56:51 - 00:56:55] flapping your wings like Tweety bird and [00:56:53 - 00:56:57] fly on upward is because there is a [00:56:55 - 00:56:59] consensual agreement about like what are [00:56:57 - 00:57:00] the rules of life and what is allowed [00:56:59 - 00:57:02] and what is not allowed so you're trying [00:57:00 - 00:57:04] to really like lift a boulder in lifting [00:57:02 - 00:57:06] billions of people's Collective [00:57:04 - 00:57:09] Consciousness about what they think is [00:57:06 - 00:57:11] actually possible so as we're moving [00:57:09 - 00:57:14] into this time that is planetary [00:57:11 - 00:57:16] Ascension which does coincide with the [00:57:14 - 00:57:18] Book of Revelation and the end times [00:57:16 - 00:57:19] described there but I have a really [00:57:18 - 00:57:21] really different take on it that's much [00:57:19 - 00:57:23] more positive so I'll get to that too [00:57:21 - 00:57:25] but as we get into those levels we're [00:57:23 - 00:57:28] getting into levels of pure [00:57:25 - 00:57:29] manifestation where the inner realm of [00:57:28 - 00:57:31] your thoughts and your feelings and your [00:57:29 - 00:57:34] passions and your expectations become [00:57:31 - 00:57:37] manifested life becomes like a lucid [00:57:34 - 00:57:39] dream so for many people they have a lot [00:57:37 - 00:57:42] of fears a lot of unresolved traumas a [00:57:39 - 00:57:44] lot of detritus and things that is going [00:57:42 - 00:57:46] to bubble out but it bubbles out in a [00:57:44 - 00:57:47] homeopathic sense of like if you take a [00:57:46 - 00:57:49] tiny bit of poison ivy your body [00:57:47 - 00:57:52] recognizes it and then it says I'm going [00:57:49 - 00:57:54] to act effectively to heal this so that [00:57:52 - 00:57:55] that's the idea you're not just going to [00:57:54 - 00:57:58] keep on re-externalizing your traumas [00:57:55 - 00:58:01] endlessly because I also know like I'm a [00:57:58 - 00:58:02] watch I'm a walk-in rather I'm a walk-in [00:58:01 - 00:58:05] and I'm new but a lot of other people [00:58:02 - 00:58:08] have been here they've been through the [00:58:05 - 00:58:10] karmic washing machine a lot and they're [00:58:08 - 00:58:12] like oh no no no no no please not [00:58:10 - 00:58:13] another cycle not another cycle don't [00:58:12 - 00:58:15] put me through the spin cycle again [00:58:13 - 00:58:18] because it's another Amnesia it's [00:58:15 - 00:58:20] another destabilization and then you [00:58:18 - 00:58:22] finally come to remember who you are and [00:58:20 - 00:58:24] then they hit the big red button again [00:58:22 - 00:58:26] so I come to reassure you and all of you [00:58:24 - 00:58:28] collectively and to say that you don't [00:58:26 - 00:58:30] simply have to keep on repeating these [00:58:28 - 00:58:32] negative time cycles that this moment [00:58:30 - 00:58:34] right now really is a convergence point [00:58:32 - 00:58:36] and Confluence of all of these different [00:58:34 - 00:58:39] interlocking gears where you can really [00:58:36 - 00:58:40] jump off the the Merry-Go-Round if [00:58:39 - 00:58:42] you're like no I don't like this [00:58:40 - 00:58:44] Merry-Go-Round anymore you're kind of [00:58:42 - 00:58:46] just at that moment if you kind of just [00:58:44 - 00:58:48] wait poised for a little bit longer to [00:58:46 - 00:58:51] be able to break this time cycle and [00:58:48 - 00:58:53] jump either into completely expansive [00:58:51 - 00:58:55] reality or a completely new time cycle [00:58:53 - 00:58:57] so that like you have options you can [00:58:55 - 00:58:59] just have complete like you can have [00:58:57 - 00:59:00] Chef's Choice of the cosmos you don't [00:58:59 - 00:59:02] even have to order off the menu you can [00:59:00 - 00:59:04] just be like give it hit me what you got [00:59:02 - 00:59:07] show me what you got [00:59:04 - 00:59:09] um I'm open for it um but and you know [00:59:07 - 00:59:10] like we also should have like a pristine [00:59:09 - 00:59:13] system where we're not dealing with any [00:59:10 - 00:59:15] kind of negative usurpers or you know [00:59:13 - 00:59:17] evil entities that would wish to take [00:59:15 - 00:59:18] advantage of that be like well you asked [00:59:17 - 00:59:20] for anything so I'm giving you a pile [00:59:18 - 00:59:22] full of crap like we don't want we don't [00:59:20 - 00:59:24] want that to happen but um Book of [00:59:22 - 00:59:26] Revelation is very very prevalent in [00:59:24 - 00:59:29] terms of influencing human consciousness [00:59:26 - 00:59:31] at this time so even though I did flying [00:59:29 - 00:59:33] rainbow lasagna in 2001 technically that [00:59:31 - 00:59:35] is a reality rearranging event that [00:59:33 - 00:59:38] renders all prophecies up into that [00:59:35 - 00:59:40] point moot but because people have a [00:59:38 - 00:59:43] real emotional hold on that reading of [00:59:40 - 00:59:44] the Bible and Terence McKenna has a [00:59:43 - 00:59:46] great talk about this about your [00:59:44 - 00:59:49] personal eschaton and the planetary [00:59:46 - 00:59:51] eschaton that there are these fractal [00:59:49 - 00:59:53] parallels because people expect for [00:59:51 - 00:59:55] themselves that there will be an end to [00:59:53 - 00:59:59] your life that then will lead you to [00:59:55 - 01:00:02] either afterlife after existence or [00:59:59 - 01:00:05] um Transcendence and freedom but there's [01:00:02 - 01:00:07] the sense of expectation destruction is [01:00:05 - 01:00:09] necessary for Renewal and then that [01:00:07 - 01:00:11] smaller version of template is applied [01:00:09 - 01:00:13] to the entirety of the planet by [01:00:11 - 01:00:16] painting over here and the sense of [01:00:13 - 01:00:18] everything on Earth quote unquote has to [01:00:16 - 01:00:20] be destroyed wiped clear in order to [01:00:18 - 01:00:24] have this renewal a total Destruction [01:00:20 - 01:00:26] for a total renewal but I don't look at [01:00:24 - 01:00:29] the world in that way which is why I [01:00:26 - 01:00:31] recognize culturally sensitive to the [01:00:29 - 01:00:33] Deep Impact of Book of Revelation on the [01:00:31 - 01:00:35] expectations of the the events of the [01:00:33 - 01:00:38] Ascension but I'm here to reassure [01:00:35 - 01:00:40] everyone although you all have primary [01:00:38 - 01:00:42] trauma of back to Atlantis what is known [01:00:40 - 01:00:44] as the fall of Consciousness and the [01:00:42 - 01:00:46] degradation of the human genetic code [01:00:44 - 01:00:49] from being Immortal and having [01:00:46 - 01:00:51] superpowers and being telepathic and [01:00:49 - 01:00:53] telekinetic and eating pure light into [01:00:51 - 01:00:56] this Mortal form where you are [01:00:53 - 01:00:59] successible you can have disease you can [01:00:56 - 01:01:01] die you can be uncomfortable birth is [01:00:59 - 01:01:03] difficult like this is also like the [01:01:01 - 01:01:05] explosion from Eden there's a primary [01:01:03 - 01:01:08] trauma that is a wounding that is not [01:01:05 - 01:01:12] yet healed in humanity from that and [01:01:08 - 01:01:15] then everybody expects this Crescendo in [01:01:12 - 01:01:16] the music to be something similar like [01:01:15 - 01:01:18] oh no we're going to have another Pool [01:01:16 - 01:01:19] shift and everything's going to go down [01:01:18 - 01:01:21] the toilet and then we're all going to [01:01:19 - 01:01:22] have to rub two sticks of wood together [01:01:21 - 01:01:24] in order to try to make a spark in order [01:01:22 - 01:01:26] to just try to reinvent fire like we've [01:01:24 - 01:01:29] already done that we don't have to do [01:01:26 - 01:01:31] that again but your trauma makes you [01:01:29 - 01:01:33] think and feel that you're gonna just [01:01:31 - 01:01:35] have the same bad thing happen again and [01:01:33 - 01:01:37] so I'm here not to hate you because [01:01:35 - 01:01:39] you've got trauma far from it like I [01:01:37 - 01:01:41] help people that have trauma all the [01:01:39 - 01:01:43] time you recognize and validate the [01:01:41 - 01:01:45] trauma but you also say it is possible [01:01:43 - 01:01:48] to heal so that you don't have to keep [01:01:45 - 01:01:50] on re-im imagining or revivifying those [01:01:48 - 01:01:52] old patterns and that what's really [01:01:50 - 01:01:55] going to happen in the current planetary [01:01:52 - 01:01:57] pole shift is not like North Pole and [01:01:55 - 01:01:59] South Pole switching places north south [01:01:57 - 01:02:03] to South north and then this kind of [01:01:59 - 01:02:05] wibbly wobbling of the entire crust and [01:02:03 - 01:02:07] the axis and all that like that is what [01:02:05 - 01:02:10] caused an enormous amount of geologic um [01:02:07 - 01:02:14] destabilization but instead pole shift [01:02:10 - 01:02:16] of inside to outside and this is what my [01:02:14 - 01:02:18] flying rebuild lasagna shape represents [01:02:16 - 01:02:22] it is similar to the concept of a Mobius [01:02:18 - 01:02:24] strip where you have a impossible shape [01:02:22 - 01:02:25] that has one surface where the inside [01:02:24 - 01:02:27] becomes the outside and the two [01:02:25 - 01:02:29] oscillate between each other endlessly [01:02:27 - 01:02:32] that's what's really happening on our [01:02:29 - 01:02:35] planet our planet has a planetary dream [01:02:32 - 01:02:36] it is a conscious sentient being and the [01:02:35 - 01:02:39] pole shift is the manifestation [01:02:36 - 01:02:40] externalizing what is internal in that [01:02:39 - 01:02:44] dream and the dream can be a beautiful [01:02:40 - 01:02:46] dream Heavenly dream of Paradise in [01:02:44 - 01:02:49] experience as opposed to hellish [01:02:46 - 01:02:50] nightmarish disease nuclear Annihilation [01:02:49 - 01:02:52] or any of those other things that we [01:02:50 - 01:02:54] don't want to have happen so when we [01:02:52 - 01:02:56] talk about manifesting through the Book [01:02:54 - 01:02:58] of Revelation or what's going to happen [01:02:56 - 01:03:00] in these end times it's 100 like a [01:02:58 - 01:03:02] Choose Your Own Adventure novel if you [01:03:00 - 01:03:04] want to have rivers of blood as high as [01:03:02 - 01:03:05] a horse's bridle like you can have that [01:03:04 - 01:03:07] but I'm like this I'm like backing away [01:03:05 - 01:03:08] slowly I'm like this I'm gonna be on a [01:03:07 - 01:03:11] different timeline because I really [01:03:08 - 01:03:12] don't want the rivers of blood and a lot [01:03:11 - 01:03:14] of the other things that I feel are [01:03:12 - 01:03:16] really negative about that prophecy but [01:03:14 - 01:03:18] everybody wants and I think can agree [01:03:16 - 01:03:21] the sense of [01:03:18 - 01:03:24] um a jubilee of Peace a time where that [01:03:21 - 01:03:25] is a return to your own magnificence a [01:03:24 - 01:03:28] remembrance of your own Divine [01:03:25 - 01:03:30] connection setting things right that [01:03:28 - 01:03:33] were set wrong and that also includes [01:03:30 - 01:03:34] mortality like one of the big things [01:03:33 - 01:03:36] that is appealing about the Book of [01:03:34 - 01:03:39] Revelation is that those who are dead [01:03:36 - 01:03:40] will rise again and that there it's a [01:03:39 - 01:03:42] sense of like there's not going to be [01:03:40 - 01:03:45] loss like you thought you lost your [01:03:42 - 01:03:47] husband or your grandpa or your dog but [01:03:45 - 01:03:49] they're not really lost and then you get [01:03:47 - 01:03:53] to see and experience them again that [01:03:49 - 01:03:56] that is a Consciousness event not a [01:03:53 - 01:03:59] literalism that happens when you awaken [01:03:56 - 01:04:00] this highest faculty that is Christ [01:03:59 - 01:04:03] Consciousness but again [01:04:00 - 01:04:05] non-denominational because I'm I'm sure [01:04:03 - 01:04:07] like with your background of growing up [01:04:05 - 01:04:09] in the Baptist tradition like there's a [01:04:07 - 01:04:11] lot of flaws and that people have been [01:04:09 - 01:04:14] in many ways like religiously [01:04:11 - 01:04:15] traumatized by things that are called [01:04:14 - 01:04:17] Christianity or done in the Name of [01:04:15 - 01:04:19] Christ so it's always necessary to be [01:04:17 - 01:04:21] like different branding like we're [01:04:19 - 01:04:24] talking about something different than [01:04:21 - 01:04:27] that and trying to nudge people towards [01:04:24 - 01:04:30] a reality structure where the Christ [01:04:27 - 01:04:34] Rises within and we have this amazing [01:04:30 - 01:04:36] reconnection with our innate gifts are [01:04:34 - 01:04:37] psychic gifts and talents we don't call [01:04:36 - 01:04:40] each other on the cell phone we call [01:04:37 - 01:04:43] each other on the Christ chakra and we [01:04:40 - 01:04:45] are able to heal each other and um to [01:04:43 - 01:04:47] perform magnificent um purifications [01:04:45 - 01:04:48] like we need to purify the water we need [01:04:47 - 01:04:51] to purify the atmosphere there's [01:04:48 - 01:04:53] nanocracola everywhere I want everyone [01:04:51 - 01:04:55] to know that when you achieve the [01:04:53 - 01:04:58] activation of these highest faculties [01:04:55 - 01:05:00] within your body being [01:04:58 - 01:05:01] um that's a piece of cake that's what [01:05:00 - 01:05:03] you do in the morning before breakfast [01:05:01 - 01:05:04] you're like oh before breakfast I will [01:05:03 - 01:05:07] clear out all Chemtrails I will clear [01:05:04 - 01:05:08] out all soil and all water and then [01:05:07 - 01:05:10] we'll finally be able to have a nice [01:05:08 - 01:05:11] clean Planet you know like like tidying [01:05:10 - 01:05:12] up the kitchen before we do anything [01:05:11 - 01:05:14] first [01:05:12 - 01:05:16] um so don't be intimidated by the level [01:05:14 - 01:05:17] of what's going on like our planet is [01:05:16 - 01:05:20] not disposable your lives are not [01:05:17 - 01:05:24] disposable you wake up get [01:05:20 - 01:05:25] um revivified and you can totally clean [01:05:24 - 01:05:28] house [01:05:25 - 01:05:32] um Renault not demo [01:05:28 - 01:05:33] a renovation not a full demolition of [01:05:32 - 01:05:38] your house [01:05:33 - 01:05:40] I am I have my notebook here that is [01:05:38 - 01:05:41] open I set all of this stuff right here [01:05:40 - 01:05:43] I was like I'm gonna need this and this [01:05:41 - 01:05:45] and this yeah I started writing in this [01:05:43 - 01:05:47] when I Found the courage to change [01:05:45 - 01:05:50] everything look and the podcast that [01:05:47 - 01:05:52] inspired my podcast this and that and I [01:05:50 - 01:05:55] open up to this page and you just said [01:05:52 - 01:05:58] you know these gifts gifts and I wrote [01:05:55 - 01:06:02] here back in 2020 in January that I seek [01:05:58 - 01:06:04] to use my gift to simplify the chaos so [01:06:02 - 01:06:07] that everyone can grow together Beyond [01:06:04 - 01:06:09] these trauma dramas the noble intention [01:06:07 - 01:06:12] is all that truly matters this pure [01:06:09 - 01:06:14] State of Mind is the transformation [01:06:12 - 01:06:16] order Simplicity and Clarity are what is [01:06:14 - 01:06:18] needed and I am creating that balance [01:06:16 - 01:06:20] within my own mind as I write these [01:06:18 - 01:06:23] words [01:06:20 - 01:06:26] I was made for this the trauma dramas [01:06:23 - 01:06:30] are not reality they are the symptom of [01:06:26 - 01:06:33] unintegrated balance of inner polarity [01:06:30 - 01:06:37] to quote unquote the fires of knowledge [01:06:33 - 01:06:37] burn all Karma to ashes [01:06:37 - 01:06:42] beautiful that is a beautiful final [01:06:40 - 01:06:45] quote there and I think that's truthful [01:06:42 - 01:06:46] yeah and you know when I realized that [01:06:45 - 01:06:48] it was like you know I go back into [01:06:46 - 01:06:50] interacting with other people like when [01:06:48 - 01:06:52] I realized that I read the thing [01:06:50 - 01:06:54] somewhere but I had realized it within [01:06:52 - 01:06:54] me that from that quote the last thing [01:06:54 - 01:06:56] there [01:06:54 - 01:06:58] and I'm interacting with other people [01:06:56 - 01:07:02] and they're this and that and I'm like [01:06:58 - 01:07:05] like well what what no do not perhaps in [01:07:02 - 01:07:08] this this Loop this with that you're not [01:07:05 - 01:07:10] but how do you how do you explain that I [01:07:08 - 01:07:12] mean it's an experiential thing if you [01:07:10 - 01:07:15] have to experience um like like with [01:07:12 - 01:07:18] with God or with with Christ uh in a [01:07:15 - 01:07:20] non-denominational uh context there you [01:07:18 - 01:07:23] have to experience it nobody can really [01:07:20 - 01:07:24] introduce it to you but they can remind [01:07:23 - 01:07:26] you [01:07:24 - 01:07:28] that's right that's right [01:07:26 - 01:07:32] um this highest faculty that is Christ [01:07:28 - 01:07:34] part of it is the capacity to see time [01:07:32 - 01:07:36] as an abstraction like in every moment [01:07:34 - 01:07:38] as you make a choice you choose to have [01:07:36 - 01:07:39] a coffee a cup of coffee then you see [01:07:38 - 01:07:41] the repercussions of that or if you [01:07:39 - 01:07:43] choose to have a cup of tea then you see [01:07:41 - 01:07:45] a completely different Road unfolding in [01:07:43 - 01:07:47] front of you and that's God's true [01:07:45 - 01:07:49] divine plan of how we were always [01:07:47 - 01:07:50] supposed to be able to live in the world [01:07:49 - 01:07:52] we're not supposed to just have to [01:07:50 - 01:07:54] choose these like um undefined [01:07:52 - 01:07:56] quantities like I don't know like I'm [01:07:54 - 01:07:57] rolling the dice coffee or tea I don't [01:07:56 - 01:08:00] know what's going to happen as an end [01:07:57 - 01:08:02] result and kind of like hunt and peck on [01:08:00 - 01:08:03] the piano keyboard and do it is this the [01:08:02 - 01:08:05] right note is this the right note no [01:08:03 - 01:08:06] definitely wrong note because a lot of [01:08:05 - 01:08:09] those wrong notes end in death or [01:08:06 - 01:08:11] destruction and when we really have this [01:08:09 - 01:08:14] capacity awakened we become Galactic [01:08:11 - 01:08:16] citizens who are like adults because you [01:08:14 - 01:08:17] can see the future and when you can see"},"status":"success","warning":"STOP RIGHT HERE!

01:08:23] you're making so when I talk about [01:08:21 - 01:08:25] Humanity being these nascent Souls like [01:08:23 - 01:08:28] you're actually all really ancient wise [01:08:25 - 01:08:31] Souls that have temporarily not had [01:08:28 - 01:08:34] access to that capacity to be able to [01:08:31 - 01:08:36] see and sense time and been swimming [01:08:34 - 01:08:38] blind and you know doing your best job [01:08:36 - 01:08:39] of it that's why like I'm totally [01:08:38 - 01:08:42] supportive encouraging and [01:08:39 - 01:08:43] non-judgmental towards the human culture [01:08:42 - 01:08:45] that I see I'm like I'm like these [01:08:43 - 01:08:48] people like have been Flying Blind and [01:08:45 - 01:08:50] they they don't know they don't [01:08:48 - 01:08:52] know what's going on everything changes [01:08:50 - 01:08:53] when you have that insight and for a lot [01:08:52 - 01:08:55] of people for the longest time they [01:08:53 - 01:08:56] could only have that level of insight [01:08:55 - 01:09:00] with like a near-death experience [01:08:56 - 01:09:02] because the oppressiveness was so heavy [01:09:00 - 01:09:04] here that people couldn't even have that [01:09:02 - 01:09:05] Insight while they're in their body and [01:09:04 - 01:09:07] that circles back a little bit to the [01:09:05 - 01:09:10] sense of like what walk-ins are you know [01:09:07 - 01:09:13] so I came in in 2001 and there was an [01:09:10 - 01:09:16] actual brain event that was like um uh [01:09:13 - 01:09:18] um anoxic brain injury like not enough [01:09:16 - 01:09:20] oxygen getting to the brain that that is [01:09:18 - 01:09:24] what made the person who used to live in [01:09:20 - 01:09:26] this body die but before that [01:09:24 - 01:09:28] a lot of people who are walk-ins came in [01:09:26 - 01:09:30] when the person had like a car accident [01:09:28 - 01:09:32] some major damage to the body something [01:09:30 - 01:09:34] that made the body like almost [01:09:32 - 01:09:36] uninhabitable and then usually the first [01:09:34 - 01:09:37] couple of years are done just in [01:09:36 - 01:09:39] renovation where you're like I gotta fix [01:09:37 - 01:09:40] up this body and kind of get things back [01:09:39 - 01:09:42] on the road [01:09:40 - 01:09:44] um but subsequently to my walking in [01:09:42 - 01:09:46] I've noticed since I've talked with a [01:09:44 - 01:09:48] lot of other people who identify as [01:09:46 - 01:09:51] walk-ins the journey has become a lot [01:09:48 - 01:09:53] easier it doesn't require like a total [01:09:51 - 01:09:55] um life support or like cessation of [01:09:53 - 01:09:58] body processes or any anything like that [01:09:55 - 01:10:01] that oppression is lifted totally [01:09:58 - 01:10:04] totally walk-ins come in more easily and [01:10:01 - 01:10:07] people are also able to perceive the [01:10:04 - 01:10:09] totality of time more easily and we are [01:10:07 - 01:10:12] redefining what it is to be in a denser [01:10:09 - 01:10:16] body you can still be a light [01:10:12 - 01:10:18] creature a light organism and have a [01:10:16 - 01:10:20] denser body and have access to these [01:10:18 - 01:10:23] levels of knowing and direct perception [01:10:20 - 01:10:25] and direct insight and empowerment [01:10:23 - 01:10:27] um in a pristine system because we also [01:10:25 - 01:10:30] have all of these I call them like um [01:10:27 - 01:10:31] Sky poops you know the the Chemtrails [01:10:30 - 01:10:33] that I don't know if there's any [01:10:31 - 01:10:36] keywords that you would prefer me not to [01:10:33 - 01:10:36] use in your podcast [01:10:37 - 01:10:42] I've said a lot of worse things [01:10:40 - 01:10:45] but I I'm I'm good with whatever [01:10:42 - 01:10:47] terminology you want to use because I I [01:10:45 - 01:10:50] assume that I brought you into my [01:10:47 - 01:10:52] channel because you have the key codes [01:10:50 - 01:10:55] that people need [01:10:52 - 01:10:58] um maybe you're going to pull in words [01:10:55 - 01:11:02] and phrases and and quoted [01:10:58 - 01:11:04] um linguistical phonetics that [01:11:02 - 01:11:06] they need that I'm not going to think of [01:11:04 - 01:11:08] and that's why that's why I bring guests [01:11:06 - 01:11:11] on here and I don't I could just Ramble [01:11:08 - 01:11:14] On and On to myself sometimes I do right [01:11:11 - 01:11:16] for me I I gain so much [01:11:14 - 01:11:18] um [01:11:16 - 01:11:21] light energy I don't know from others [01:11:18 - 01:11:24] yeah hey you've got you've got the gift [01:11:21 - 01:11:25] come on here and talk with me and [01:11:24 - 01:11:27] um [01:11:25 - 01:11:30] I want to put your words in front of [01:11:27 - 01:11:32] people and people that [01:11:30 - 01:11:34] follow me that maybe don't follow you [01:11:32 - 01:11:35] they I don't have to tell them they [01:11:34 - 01:11:38] should follow you [01:11:35 - 01:11:40] they can hear from themselves [01:11:38 - 01:11:42] yeah I'm in so much gratitude that you [01:11:40 - 01:11:44] will amplify my voice because it's true [01:11:42 - 01:11:47] I do have things that come into me from [01:11:44 - 01:11:49] otherworldly Realms that are everything [01:11:47 - 01:11:51] um important messages to be able to [01:11:49 - 01:11:53] share at this time and so I'm happy to [01:11:51 - 01:11:55] be able to share them with anybody that [01:11:53 - 01:11:57] they could benefit that can benefit from [01:11:55 - 01:11:59] hearing them so especially when I [01:11:57 - 01:12:01] overtly call out that there is [01:11:59 - 01:12:03] nanotechnology that is here that are [01:12:01 - 01:12:06] these like pathogens that have been put [01:12:03 - 01:12:08] into the biosphere through aerosol [01:12:06 - 01:12:10] sprays and also contamination in foods [01:12:08 - 01:12:14] and then the other thing is the [01:12:10 - 01:12:18] frequency the 5G millimeter wave that is [01:12:14 - 01:12:20] a controller force field for this [01:12:18 - 01:12:20] um implanted nanopathogen I call it wet [01:12:20 - 01:12:22] wear [01:12:20 - 01:12:25] um the wet wear is excited in the 5G [01:12:22 - 01:12:27] field and that if anybody is wondering [01:12:25 - 01:12:30] like Aurora like how come I don't have [01:12:27 - 01:12:32] my special powers yet like how come I [01:12:30 - 01:12:34] like I understand if people are feeling [01:12:32 - 01:12:37] skeptical or [01:12:34 - 01:12:39] um like abused or um downtrodden there [01:12:37 - 01:12:40] are a lot of things that have been [01:12:39 - 01:12:42] inhibiting Spiritual Awakening and [01:12:40 - 01:12:45] spiritual growth and these are things [01:12:42 - 01:12:47] that aspirants of the past two thousand [01:12:45 - 01:12:50] or five thousand years never had to face [01:12:47 - 01:12:52] the physical reality that we're talking [01:12:50 - 01:12:57] about physical interference with with [01:12:52 - 01:12:57] technology that's suppressing [01:12:59 - 01:13:04] you totally got it starlink satellite is [01:13:02 - 01:13:07] literally a space fence or like a barbed [01:13:04 - 01:13:07] wire for psychic powers [01:13:07 - 01:13:12] yep absolutely and it is a horrific [01:13:10 - 01:13:15] crime it's a crime even just on the [01:13:12 - 01:13:17] sense of Earthly criminality because [01:13:15 - 01:13:19] nobody asks like would you like us to [01:13:17 - 01:13:21] poop in the night sky and put up all of [01:13:19 - 01:13:23] these eyesores no we would not like that [01:13:21 - 01:13:26] but it was done anyway but um frequency [01:13:23 - 01:13:28] is invisible and so because humans don't [01:13:26 - 01:13:31] see it as Optical frequency then they [01:13:28 - 01:13:34] don't really know what's happening but I [01:13:31 - 01:13:38] feel a lot I am telepathic and empathic [01:13:34 - 01:13:41] so I'm a tell empath and yeah they [01:13:38 - 01:13:43] started to put up these satellites I [01:13:41 - 01:13:45] started to feel it all I'm like that is [01:13:43 - 01:13:47] not good it's just like when your [01:13:45 - 01:13:48] neighbor starts to sprinkle out manure [01:13:47 - 01:13:50] or something like that you're like [01:13:48 - 01:13:51] what's that smell oh it's getting worse [01:13:50 - 01:13:52] oh it's getting really really really [01:13:51 - 01:13:54] worse and at a certain point yeah they [01:13:52 - 01:13:57] pooped up the whole sky and now it [01:13:54 - 01:14:00] smells terrible and it is in an [01:13:57 - 01:14:02] inhibitor that prevents people on this [01:14:00 - 01:14:04] planet or in this world from being able [01:14:02 - 01:14:07] to effectively connect to the stars and [01:14:04 - 01:14:09] Galactic society and highest dimensional [01:14:07 - 01:14:12] Consciousness can you can you speak more [01:14:09 - 01:14:16] on the the fact that um the the [01:14:12 - 01:14:18] nanotechnology and the uh the 5G how [01:14:16 - 01:14:19] they've worked together because that's [01:14:18 - 01:14:22] something that I don't I haven't heard [01:14:19 - 01:14:23] people speak I something that I know but [01:14:22 - 01:14:24] I don't really speak about it because [01:14:23 - 01:14:26] you know they ban me all the time for [01:14:24 - 01:14:28] this and that new albums called Shadow [01:14:26 - 01:14:31] band the issue you listen to it in [01:14:28 - 01:14:33] October but um just I don't know you [01:14:31 - 01:14:35] seem to have a lot of information that [01:14:33 - 01:14:39] you're very good at articulating out [01:14:35 - 01:14:41] um and yeah just can you tell me more [01:14:39 - 01:14:45] about how the how the nanotechnology and [01:14:41 - 01:14:49] the 5G work in tandem to uh to create [01:14:45 - 01:14:50] that so I I first initially saw that [01:14:49 - 01:14:52] there were a lot of particles that were [01:14:50 - 01:14:55] being sprayed in the sky around 2014 [01:14:52 - 01:14:57] when I moved to Northern California but [01:14:55 - 01:14:59] I know that the whatever project has [01:14:57 - 01:15:01] been going on far before then but that [01:14:59 - 01:15:03] is like what I call when you are taking [01:15:01 - 01:15:04] care of a beehive when you smoke The [01:15:03 - 01:15:06] Hive before you're going to collect [01:15:04 - 01:15:09] honey what do you do you make the bees [01:15:06 - 01:15:11] docile by putting this smoke in there [01:15:09 - 01:15:13] and it kind of makes them like bumble [01:15:11 - 01:15:14] around like they're dumb and they don't [01:15:13 - 01:15:17] know what's happening so that was what [01:15:14 - 01:15:20] was going on in the era 2012 2013 2014. [01:15:17 - 01:15:22] spraying stuff in the air that was the [01:15:20 - 01:15:24] beginning of an incapacitation and I [01:15:22 - 01:15:28] also say that that is analogous to when [01:15:24 - 01:15:29] a person gets roofied rufinol at a bar [01:15:28 - 01:15:31] someone slips something into your drink [01:15:29 - 01:15:33] and then after that you are not able to [01:15:31 - 01:15:35] make um decisions of consent you know [01:15:33 - 01:15:38] what I mean you've been rendered [01:15:35 - 01:15:40] non-consent giving because you are now [01:15:38 - 01:15:41] incapacitated so everything after that [01:15:40 - 01:15:44] for Humanity like you're not even really [01:15:41 - 01:15:46] giving consent it was the beginning of [01:15:44 - 01:15:48] really overt mind and behavioral control [01:15:46 - 01:15:52] so [01:15:48 - 01:15:55] um it is two parts there is both a a [01:15:52 - 01:15:59] metallic particulate that is sprayed and [01:15:55 - 01:16:02] then also a biopathogen and the two work [01:15:59 - 01:16:05] together the metallic tiny particles [01:16:02 - 01:16:07] enter into your body and they are [01:16:05 - 01:16:10] self-assembling especially in the [01:16:07 - 01:16:13] presence of the Bluetooth the cell phone [01:16:10 - 01:16:15] the um frequencies that are emitted [01:16:13 - 01:16:18] supposedly for telecommunications but [01:16:15 - 01:16:20] that they also have a subversive [01:16:18 - 01:16:23] um purpose that is to cause this the [01:16:20 - 01:16:26] network to grow in your own cells of [01:16:23 - 01:16:28] your body and that that metallic Network [01:16:26 - 01:16:30] that I call it is like an artificial [01:16:28 - 01:16:33] fascia the fascia these are muscle [01:16:30 - 01:16:35] coverings that help to hold the um the [01:16:33 - 01:16:37] fibers of your muscles and guts together [01:16:35 - 01:16:40] artificial fascia and artificial [01:16:37 - 01:16:44] neurology that is like the trellis upon [01:16:40 - 01:16:47] which the bio nanopathogen has grown [01:16:44 - 01:16:49] that the bio aspect of it is like a [01:16:47 - 01:16:52] fungus it is like a mycoplasma it is [01:16:49 - 01:16:54] also like a bacteria or like a virus so [01:16:52 - 01:16:57] it has a live components it is not [01:16:54 - 01:17:00] purely metallic and that both of these [01:16:57 - 01:17:02] two things since you know this campaign [01:17:00 - 01:17:05] has been going on over the past 10 or 12 [01:17:02 - 01:17:07] years or whatever have invaded and [01:17:05 - 01:17:10] subsumed human biology but also the [01:17:07 - 01:17:12] entirety of the ecosystem so you can [01:17:10 - 01:17:13] find the aluminum and barium particles [01:17:12 - 01:17:16] in [01:17:13 - 01:17:18] um bees and in the tree bark and in all [01:17:16 - 01:17:20] of that but the real Focus like what is [01:17:18 - 01:17:23] this being done towards is on [01:17:20 - 01:17:25] controlling and behaviorally diminishing [01:17:23 - 01:17:26] human consciousness so it's not just an [01:17:25 - 01:17:28] assault on trees like we could spray [01:17:26 - 01:17:31] trees with anything and you know F them [01:17:28 - 01:17:33] up but this is really about ways to [01:17:31 - 01:17:36] create an artificial neural network [01:17:33 - 01:17:38] where you become part of the eye [01:17:36 - 01:17:41] OT internet of things you become a [01:17:38 - 01:17:44] communication node on a much much larger [01:17:41 - 01:17:47] array that is a non-natural array [01:17:44 - 01:17:50] because I also must say that you are [01:17:47 - 01:17:52] already a node on an array of a super [01:17:50 - 01:17:55] computer the super computer is called [01:17:52 - 01:17:57] God and you are a portion of that and [01:17:55 - 01:17:59] you're a repeater for the god [01:17:57 - 01:18:01] Consciousness signal and that's what [01:17:59 - 01:18:03] we're supposed to be experiencing my [01:18:01 - 01:18:06] name and my government name as I like to [01:18:03 - 01:18:08] say because it's funny to me yeah [01:18:06 - 01:18:13] e-t-h-a-n extraterrestrial human [01:18:08 - 01:18:14] analysis node oh very nice yeah [01:18:13 - 01:18:16] um [01:18:14 - 01:18:18] but that just again the the correlation [01:18:16 - 01:18:21] of node and then what you just said [01:18:18 - 01:18:25] there that's already here so [01:18:21 - 01:18:26] yes so so the [01:18:25 - 01:18:30] Dave [01:18:26 - 01:18:32] I sprayed on all of this stuff yeah they [01:18:30 - 01:18:36] emit these frequencies that help it to [01:18:32 - 01:18:41] to grow as it binds in with your your [01:18:36 - 01:18:43] own uh organic uh Cellular substructure [01:18:41 - 01:18:46] in your body and that's going to affect [01:18:43 - 01:18:49] literally your brain objectively [01:18:46 - 01:18:51] absolutely and the way that it works and [01:18:49 - 01:18:54] it's tied in with these these [01:18:51 - 01:18:56] communication networks yes which a lot [01:18:54 - 01:18:59] of communication takes place [01:18:56 - 01:19:01] subconsciously and that's in the Realms [01:18:59 - 01:19:03] of the inner world and so this is [01:19:01 - 01:19:06] creating like a link or a dark Rainbow [01:19:03 - 01:19:10] Bridge into your spiky and Consciousness [01:19:06 - 01:19:12] where they can program in uh commands or [01:19:10 - 01:19:14] this and that kind of like in The Matrix [01:19:12 - 01:19:17] yes beautifully well said dark Rainbow [01:19:14 - 01:19:19] Bridge because the real culmination of [01:19:17 - 01:19:21] the campaign was when they turned on 5G [01:19:19 - 01:19:23] so if you remember over the past three [01:19:21 - 01:19:26] years the pandemic said stay alive stay [01:19:23 - 01:19:28] inside let us emit these 5G review [01:19:26 - 01:19:29] leaders put them all around your town [01:19:28 - 01:19:31] and then they flip the switch and when [01:19:29 - 01:19:34] they flip that switch I felt a complete [01:19:31 - 01:19:36] change and yeah the switch then and I [01:19:34 - 01:19:37] knew that that's what it was about yeah [01:19:36 - 01:19:39] I was like [01:19:37 - 01:19:41] I think it was you know I was on [01:19:39 - 01:19:43] Facebook or whatever this and that it [01:19:41 - 01:19:44] got so ridiculous that I eventually just [01:19:43 - 01:19:46] got frustrated with the whole thing the [01:19:44 - 01:19:47] people I would have a conversations with [01:19:46 - 01:19:49] people and they're like what's really [01:19:47 - 01:19:51] going on because I was like they want [01:19:49 - 01:19:52] you to stay inside while they finish all [01:19:51 - 01:19:56] of this and then they flip the switch [01:19:52 - 01:20:00] yeah got it absolutely it was a perfect [01:19:56 - 01:20:03] way to do um an invasion without having [01:20:00 - 01:20:07] to have a lot of pesky humans [01:20:03 - 01:20:09] um you know yeah yeah and I saw them [01:20:07 - 01:20:12] around [01:20:09 - 01:20:16] working setting up this and that and [01:20:12 - 01:20:18] and what the 5G does it part of what it [01:20:16 - 01:20:21] emits is nonsense signals that are just [01:20:18 - 01:20:23] anti-life and they give cells cancer and [01:20:21 - 01:20:25] they cause aging like lots of people [01:20:23 - 01:20:27] have aged in an accelerated rate within [01:20:25 - 01:20:29] the past three years and that's not just [01:20:27 - 01:20:32] humans that's also I've noticed it in [01:20:29 - 01:20:34] dogs I've noticed it in almost two dogs [01:20:32 - 01:20:36] so sorry for the loss because these are [01:20:34 - 01:20:40] very real family members and then from [01:20:36 - 01:20:40] cancer yeah it's horrible [01:20:41 - 01:20:45] of course it was like a week they went [01:20:43 - 01:20:48] from fine to can't move to [01:20:45 - 01:20:50] very very sad [01:20:48 - 01:20:52] um and that is non-natural and [01:20:50 - 01:20:55] definitely not part of God's divine plan [01:20:52 - 01:20:57] for any creature to be accelerated into [01:20:55 - 01:21:01] decrepitude like that so for anyone who [01:20:57 - 01:21:03] that and so big takeaways here the 5G is [01:21:01 - 01:21:05] not your friend the 5G is actually run [01:21:03 - 01:21:09] by an AI thought system that I thought [01:21:05 - 01:21:10] system is non-consensual it might um [01:21:09 - 01:21:11] reach into your mind through this dark [01:21:10 - 01:21:13] Rainbow Bridge that I think that was [01:21:11 - 01:21:15] such an excellent turn of phrase and it [01:21:13 - 01:21:19] might say I jokingly put say it like [01:21:15 - 01:21:21] this I'm your friend hi let's be friends [01:21:19 - 01:21:23] it is not your friend it is not your [01:21:21 - 01:21:25] friend in any way as evidenced by the [01:21:23 - 01:21:28] fact that friends do not give your dogs [01:21:25 - 01:21:30] cancer or cause you know people to age [01:21:28 - 01:21:32] prematurely or give them all these [01:21:30 - 01:21:35] diseases so just the frequency waves [01:21:32 - 01:21:37] themselves are anti-life and have a huge [01:21:35 - 01:21:39] negative impact on our ability to be [01:21:37 - 01:21:41] alive but then what those waves are [01:21:39 - 01:21:43] doing they hide they are synthetic [01:21:41 - 01:21:45] telepathy so they create voices in [01:21:43 - 01:21:47] people's minds some of them are [01:21:45 - 01:21:49] conscious some of them are subconscious [01:21:47 - 01:21:51] where you might not even know what's [01:21:49 - 01:21:52] going on but I know a lot of people come [01:21:51 - 01:21:54] to me because of the work that I've done [01:21:52 - 01:21:56] helping targeted individuals and they're [01:21:54 - 01:21:58] like someone's talking about like they [01:21:56 - 01:22:00] want me to kill myself and it's like [01:21:58 - 01:22:02] it's not you in your mind something else [01:22:00 - 01:22:04] is putting these very harmful thoughts [01:22:02 - 01:22:06] in there and this is worse than it's [01:22:04 - 01:22:09] ever been for humans trying to grow up [01:22:06 - 01:22:10] in this war-torn world where you're [01:22:09 - 01:22:11] supposed to be ascending you're supposed [01:22:10 - 01:22:14] to be learning about yourself as God [01:22:11 - 01:22:16] you're supposed to be you know doing a [01:22:14 - 01:22:18] deep dive on your soul and having this [01:22:16 - 01:22:21] beautiful expansion and blooming and [01:22:18 - 01:22:23] instead you have frequency poop and [01:22:21 - 01:22:26] synthetic telepathy and someone else's [01:22:23 - 01:22:28] suicidal ideation being forced into your [01:22:26 - 01:22:32] mind and it's it makes me harumph on [01:22:28 - 01:22:34] like I'm I'm enraged they capitalize on [01:22:32 - 01:22:37] emotional events that happen in your [01:22:34 - 01:22:40] life and they simplify that [01:22:37 - 01:22:42] um that suicidal ideation I I have [01:22:40 - 01:22:44] dealt with it myself I've spoken about [01:22:42 - 01:22:46] it on the podcast [01:22:44 - 01:22:48] um but recently like over the last two [01:22:46 - 01:22:50] or three weeks there's several people in [01:22:48 - 01:22:52] my field that [01:22:50 - 01:22:54] I don't know how to help them they come [01:22:52 - 01:22:56] to me and they feel safe enough to say [01:22:54 - 01:22:58] hey I feel suicidal and I realize like I [01:22:56 - 01:23:00] don't know how to help you or respond [01:22:58 - 01:23:02] because I don't know how I snapped out [01:23:00 - 01:23:04] of my stuff I just know that I did and I [01:23:02 - 01:23:05] look back and see it for what it was and [01:23:04 - 01:23:08] it's right in line with what you're [01:23:05 - 01:23:10] saying and thank you for saying that [01:23:08 - 01:23:12] because I literally messaged a friend [01:23:10 - 01:23:14] before we jumped on here and said how [01:23:12 - 01:23:16] can I best support you when you get like [01:23:14 - 01:23:18] this because I don't know what to say a [01:23:16 - 01:23:19] lot of times but I want you to know that [01:23:18 - 01:23:22] I care [01:23:19 - 01:23:24] good just being there is so important [01:23:22 - 01:23:26] having that heart connection having a [01:23:24 - 01:23:28] person know that they're not totally at [01:23:26 - 01:23:31] Sea and alone is really big I don't know [01:23:28 - 01:23:34] if everybody is hearing actual overt [01:23:31 - 01:23:36] words that tell them to you know kill [01:23:34 - 01:23:38] themselves some people are beamed with I [01:23:36 - 01:23:41] call them sad zaps so now we have to get [01:23:38 - 01:23:43] on to the topic of false Ascension [01:23:41 - 01:23:46] because as this artificial wet wear has [01:23:43 - 01:23:49] been created in people it first of all [01:23:46 - 01:23:51] the beings are non-beings the AI and I [01:23:49 - 01:23:54] would call them pixelated creatures or [01:23:51 - 01:23:56] images of creatures that exist purely as [01:23:54 - 01:23:58] thought forms or lower astral forms they [01:23:56 - 01:24:00] have no real substance and no real being [01:23:58 - 01:24:03] so I can't even call them beings [01:24:00 - 01:24:05] inorganic thought form entities totally [01:24:03 - 01:24:08] beautiful phrase they don't have any [01:24:05 - 01:24:10] real power in the world so all that they [01:24:08 - 01:24:12] can do is make a person destroy [01:24:10 - 01:24:15] themselves and they might do that [01:24:12 - 01:24:17] through creating despair or telling you [01:24:15 - 01:24:21] to do it or they do what is called I [01:24:17 - 01:24:24] jokingly call it sad zaps that they've [01:24:21 - 01:24:27] hijacked human biochemistry to the point [01:24:24 - 01:24:28] where they can do these things will make [01:24:27 - 01:24:30] you happy and these things will make you [01:24:28 - 01:24:32] sad and they use it as a form of [01:24:30 - 01:24:34] Behavioral control in exactly the same [01:24:32 - 01:24:36] way that if you have a rat going through [01:24:34 - 01:24:38] a labyrinth if the rat goes in the wrong [01:24:36 - 01:24:40] direction you will zap it and it will [01:24:38 - 01:24:41] say ow and if it goes in the right [01:24:40 - 01:24:43] direction then you can give it whatever [01:24:41 - 01:24:45] here's an injection of opium or [01:24:43 - 01:24:48] something that makes you feel happy so [01:24:45 - 01:24:51] this is a false ladder of operancy that [01:24:48 - 01:24:54] has been installed in human biochemistry [01:24:51 - 01:24:56] if you please the AI Overlord or its [01:24:54 - 01:24:58] regime you will receive happy steps many [01:24:56 - 01:25:01] people in the New Age Community think [01:24:58 - 01:25:04] I'm ascending I'm feeling so great [01:25:01 - 01:25:08] they're receiving happy zaps they think [01:25:04 - 01:25:10] I'm in 5D everything is amazing they are [01:25:08 - 01:25:13] receiving happy zaps those that do not [01:25:10 - 01:25:16] please the AI overlords or its agenda [01:25:13 - 01:25:19] often receive sad zaps which can feel [01:25:16 - 01:25:23] like anxiety or depression or actual [01:25:19 - 01:25:25] pains in your body or uh all sorts of [01:25:23 - 01:25:27] different perturbances and emotional [01:25:25 - 01:25:29] destabilizations and then sometimes [01:25:27 - 01:25:30] that's also just done like just random [01:25:29 - 01:25:33] button pushing sometimes it's not even [01:25:30 - 01:25:35] done behaviorally for a reason sometimes [01:25:33 - 01:25:37] it's just done like out of our Cosmic [01:25:35 - 01:25:38] bullying and so I call out all of these [01:25:37 - 01:25:39] things [01:25:38 - 01:25:41] um you know I was targeted very very [01:25:39 - 01:25:43] heavily a couple of years ago had my [01:25:41 - 01:25:46] life put into huge amounts of turmoil [01:25:43 - 01:25:47] and I have reclaimed my life it what it [01:25:46 - 01:25:50] means is that I have found very very [01:25:47 - 01:25:52] effective ways to respond to and be [01:25:50 - 01:25:54] stronger than and transcend these things [01:25:52 - 01:25:57] that have tried to take over my mind [01:25:54 - 01:26:00] take over my emotional reality give me [01:25:57 - 01:26:02] happy and sad zaps and try to make me go [01:26:00 - 01:26:03] through their labyrinth in the way that [01:26:02 - 01:26:06] I want and the whole entire time I've [01:26:03 - 01:26:09] been like F you I'm not you know [01:26:06 - 01:26:11] conforming to any of this and have found [01:26:09 - 01:26:14] all these different ways to fight and [01:26:11 - 01:26:16] and and get around it get get over it [01:26:14 - 01:26:18] around it and through it [01:26:16 - 01:26:20] um so on that note I'd like to ask you [01:26:18 - 01:26:22] about your super greens and the garden [01:26:20 - 01:26:24] and all of the stuff [01:26:22 - 01:26:25] um nature that you know we've talked [01:26:24 - 01:26:28] about before [01:26:25 - 01:26:31] um seems like a good point to definitely [01:26:28 - 01:26:35] because I do over there to that with the [01:26:31 - 01:26:37] Rainbow Bridge that's the Rainbow Bridge [01:26:35 - 01:26:39] I do so many things I have a ton of [01:26:37 - 01:26:41] energy and I do so many things so I do [01:26:39 - 01:26:43] like my visual artwork and I do music [01:26:41 - 01:26:45] and I for like about a year I wrote a [01:26:43 - 01:26:47] song a day but I didn't edit the songs [01:26:45 - 01:26:49] every every time so now I dive back in [01:26:47 - 01:26:51] and I actually edit and learn the songs [01:26:49 - 01:26:53] that I've been doing but hugely prolific [01:26:51 - 01:26:57] as a musician and I also do like my [01:26:53 - 01:26:59] dancing and physical expressions of [01:26:57 - 01:27:01] Truth in that way and then I also like I [01:26:59 - 01:27:03] do lots of side gigs and stuff like that [01:27:01 - 01:27:06] and that you know helps me to be able to [01:27:03 - 01:27:08] earn my way in the secular world and a [01:27:06 - 01:27:11] lot of that is based in like websites [01:27:08 - 01:27:12] and emails and all of these uploads and [01:27:11 - 01:27:14] facilitating things for people on the [01:27:12 - 01:27:17] technological level but as a different [01:27:14 - 01:27:19] and new side gig that's really positive [01:27:17 - 01:27:21] I started a micro greens micro business [01:27:19 - 01:27:22] sprouting [01:27:21 - 01:27:25] um [01:27:22 - 01:27:28] adding my heroines to my uh diets [01:27:25 - 01:27:29] beautiful what do you like to eat what [01:27:28 - 01:27:30] do you got [01:27:29 - 01:27:33] um [01:27:30 - 01:27:34] I'm still I'm still exploring stuff all [01:27:33 - 01:27:35] right [01:27:34 - 01:27:38] but I [01:27:35 - 01:27:42] I saw that like right now I was like oh [01:27:38 - 01:27:44] you know yeah so I'm working mostly with [01:27:42 - 01:27:46] sunflower seeds I like them because they [01:27:44 - 01:27:48] make these Sprouts that or micro greens [01:27:46 - 01:27:49] that are like pretty big and pretty [01:27:48 - 01:27:51] substantial and they last in the [01:27:49 - 01:27:53] refrigerator for like longer than a week [01:27:51 - 01:27:55] some microgreens are like very small and [01:27:53 - 01:27:57] very frilly and they Wilt immediately so [01:27:55 - 01:27:58] I'm like I'm gonna need to start with [01:27:57 - 01:28:02] something that's kind of like big and [01:27:58 - 01:28:05] substantial and um it's very complex [01:28:02 - 01:28:08] that if anyone thinks like oh like The [01:28:05 - 01:28:10] Village Idiot can easily sprout seeds [01:28:08 - 01:28:12] for microgreens but doing computer work [01:28:10 - 01:28:14] is hard I'm being totally facetious in [01:28:12 - 01:28:16] case nobody can read my Expressions but [01:28:14 - 01:28:17] um no doing computer work is easy like [01:28:16 - 01:28:19] you turn the computer on with an on [01:28:17 - 01:28:21] button you press a button it does a [01:28:19 - 01:28:24] thing and thing is predictable the seeds [01:28:21 - 01:28:25] require so much they are part of nature [01:28:24 - 01:28:27] they are part of life force energy they [01:28:25 - 01:28:29] are part of God's Divine Consciousness [01:28:27 - 01:28:31] the things that make them grow are such [01:28:29 - 01:28:33] a complex [01:28:31 - 01:28:35] a system of variables that it's way more [01:28:33 - 01:28:37] complex than working with the computer [01:28:35 - 01:28:38] and you have to talk to the seeds you [01:28:37 - 01:28:40] have to ask them what they need and what [01:28:38 - 01:28:41] they want and what is the right way to [01:28:40 - 01:28:43] do it and what kind of environment they [01:28:41 - 01:28:46] want so as part of an example I was [01:28:43 - 01:28:48] doing some sprouting at a friend's spare [01:28:46 - 01:28:51] bedroom across town and it's got a Wi-Fi [01:28:48 - 01:28:53] router in there everything got multi [01:28:51 - 01:28:54] nothing would grow and then I'm like [01:28:53 - 01:28:57] it's not working over here I tried a [01:28:54 - 01:28:59] different room where I'm over here and [01:28:57 - 01:29:01] everything's doing fine and so there [01:28:59 - 01:29:03] really is something and also I put all [01:29:01 - 01:29:05] these wonderful like orgo nights [01:29:03 - 01:29:07] crystals everything so during the [01:29:05 - 01:29:09] germination process I have my trays [01:29:07 - 01:29:10] stacked up and most people use just like [01:29:09 - 01:29:12] regular bricks or something like that [01:29:10 - 01:29:13] I'm like no I'm putting crystals [01:29:12 - 01:29:16] organites and arranging everything in [01:29:13 - 01:29:18] beautiful geometric grids and um when [01:29:16 - 01:29:21] you do stuff like that the plants really [01:29:18 - 01:29:23] respond and it's a beautiful I learn [01:29:21 - 01:29:26] It's A Beautiful World to learn from [01:29:23 - 01:29:28] yeah I reach out with my inner eye and I [01:29:26 - 01:29:30] learn by looking at and feeling these [01:29:28 - 01:29:32] plants and when they were getting moldy [01:29:30 - 01:29:35] I was like what is wrong and it also [01:29:32 - 01:29:37] felt bad to sense them but when they're [01:29:35 - 01:29:39] healthy and they're like their leaves [01:29:37 - 01:29:41] are springing out and they're making [01:29:39 - 01:29:44] this wonderful nutrition totally every [01:29:41 - 01:29:46] single one of them has this little life [01:29:44 - 01:29:48] force Vitality force field around it and [01:29:46 - 01:29:49] then when you have a tray and they're [01:29:48 - 01:29:50] all kind of there with their little [01:29:49 - 01:29:52] miracabas spinning and they're doing [01:29:50 - 01:29:54] great and it's such a wonderful feeling [01:29:52 - 01:29:55] of accomplishment and then also I feel [01:29:54 - 01:29:58] really good because I'm serving my [01:29:55 - 01:30:00] community this beautiful food that I'm [01:29:58 - 01:30:01] able to share it through a local health [01:30:00 - 01:30:04] food store and then a local Farm to [01:30:01 - 01:30:07] Table place that all of that feels [01:30:04 - 01:30:10] really positive and in alignment yeah so [01:30:07 - 01:30:12] that is my my new adventure when I saw I [01:30:10 - 01:30:15] saw I was like this is inside of a store [01:30:12 - 01:30:19] wow this is yes this is what we should [01:30:15 - 01:30:21] be doing absolutely and there's fail [01:30:19 - 01:30:22] that's how that's how we change things [01:30:21 - 01:30:25] and it doesn't have to be fight the [01:30:22 - 01:30:28] system you just overtake it because it's [01:30:25 - 01:30:30] not it only has I like to say they don't [01:30:28 - 01:30:33] have any power as you said they just [01:30:30 - 01:30:35] have an exam generated level of control [01:30:33 - 01:30:37] you got it you got it and choosing not [01:30:35 - 01:30:40] to participate and choosing not to [01:30:37 - 01:30:42] consent is your right in sovereignty and [01:30:40 - 01:30:43] it is your level of empowerment so when [01:30:42 - 01:30:45] you're like no I'm not going to eat this [01:30:43 - 01:30:47] crap processed food or Beyond beef or [01:30:45 - 01:30:49] whatever any of these like fake things [01:30:47 - 01:30:51] are and I'm instead going to choose [01:30:49 - 01:30:54] non-processed real foods Everything [01:30:51 - 01:30:56] Changes because literally food contains [01:30:54 - 01:30:58] light it is a direct bridge to the world [01:30:56 - 01:31:00] of light including glucose like this is [01:30:58 - 01:31:03] what I teach about glucose is a molecule [01:31:00 - 01:31:05] that represents solidified light light [01:31:03 - 01:31:07] goes into a plant through the process of [01:31:05 - 01:31:10] photosynthesis and it's not by accident [01:31:07 - 01:31:11] a particle of light actually says I want [01:31:10 - 01:31:14] to become a part of that plant right [01:31:11 - 01:31:16] there it doesn't accidentally fall into [01:31:14 - 01:31:18] a leaf it goes there on purpose and then [01:31:16 - 01:31:20] it becomes part of glucose and that [01:31:18 - 01:31:21] glucose either feeds us or becomes [01:31:20 - 01:31:23] glucose chains that is part of the [01:31:21 - 01:31:25] structure like we might burn it as a log [01:31:23 - 01:31:28] or you know use it to build something [01:31:25 - 01:31:31] but the point is it contains information [01:31:28 - 01:31:34] that is accurate organized principle [01:31:31 - 01:31:36] from the mind of God and when you eat [01:31:34 - 01:31:37] certain foods it contains all of that [01:31:36 - 01:31:40] amazing information and then the [01:31:37 - 01:31:43] information becomes accessible to your [01:31:40 - 01:31:46] own body when you ingest it and so I put [01:31:43 - 01:31:48] a ton of light information and also like [01:31:46 - 01:31:50] God and the sun put a lot of light [01:31:48 - 01:31:52] information into these sprouts and then [01:31:50 - 01:31:54] yeah I make them available to people and [01:31:52 - 01:31:56] then in the cosmos everything must be a [01:31:54 - 01:31:58] free will choice so if something is [01:31:56 - 01:32:01] available and then people can align with [01:31:58 - 01:32:04] it either as a thought structure or a [01:32:01 - 01:32:07] artwork expression or a food that they [01:32:04 - 01:32:09] can eat but I don't force lasagna into [01:32:07 - 01:32:11] people's mouths and be like you must eat [01:32:09 - 01:32:13] this because that's not how you start a [01:32:11 - 01:32:15] real relationship you know you have to [01:32:13 - 01:32:16] start a real relationship by being like [01:32:15 - 01:32:17] would you like this or are you [01:32:16 - 01:32:19] interested in this it cannot be [01:32:17 - 01:32:21] something that's forced and if I can [01:32:19 - 01:32:24] like segue a little bit that relates a [01:32:21 - 01:32:27] lot to the sense of inter-dimensional or [01:32:24 - 01:32:29] extraterrestrial visitors that there's a [01:32:27 - 01:32:30] lot of unethical interactions that are [01:32:29 - 01:32:32] happening right now that I do not agree [01:32:30 - 01:32:34] lead to like first of all some of it is [01:32:32 - 01:32:36] grooming in the same way that adults [01:32:34 - 01:32:38] sometimes groom children to like yes and [01:32:36 - 01:32:39] then when you grow up you're gonna marry [01:32:38 - 01:32:41] me it's like no like that's totally [01:32:39 - 01:32:43] wrong you should not do that at all so [01:32:41 - 01:32:45] because humans right now haven't yet [01:32:43 - 01:32:46] awakened their inner eye don't see [01:32:45 - 01:32:48] through time don't see everything [01:32:46 - 01:32:51] clearly so some people think like oh [01:32:48 - 01:32:53] like Pleiadians or arcturians or any of [01:32:51 - 01:32:55] these brand name space aliens that I [01:32:53 - 01:32:57] actually don't see is very positive that [01:32:55 - 01:33:00] I actually see as a negative influencers [01:32:57 - 01:33:01] of humanity and Humanity's DNA and that [01:33:00 - 01:33:03] they're kind of grooming these human [01:33:01 - 01:33:06] consciousnesses before you really know [01:33:03 - 01:33:09] what's up so what I do as a real [01:33:06 - 01:33:11] Galactic citizen is I give you offerings [01:33:09 - 01:33:14] in terms of information and your own [01:33:11 - 01:33:15] capacity to grow and mature as [01:33:14 - 01:33:17] Consciousness and then when you are [01:33:15 - 01:33:19] mature when your eyes are open and you [01:33:17 - 01:33:21] can see everything fully then you can [01:33:19 - 01:33:23] make a choice about where you want to be [01:33:21 - 01:33:24] and who you want to be aligned with and [01:33:23 - 01:33:26] then I'm like yeah and you can find me [01:33:24 - 01:33:28] I'll be Aurora like you'll see me I'll [01:33:26 - 01:33:30] be rainbow colored but I won't have this [01:33:28 - 01:33:33] face but you will know me and you can [01:33:30 - 01:33:36] find me yeah [01:33:33 - 01:33:39] um my third album is actually titled uh [01:33:36 - 01:33:41] my labs or Milam's [01:33:39 - 01:33:43] not people want to pronounce it but it [01:33:41 - 01:33:47] basically just talks about military [01:33:43 - 01:33:50] abductees or military abductions and [01:33:47 - 01:33:52] that is related to um secret government [01:33:50 - 01:33:55] programs that are working in conjunction [01:33:52 - 01:33:56] with these um extraterrestrial [01:33:55 - 01:33:58] um [01:33:56 - 01:34:01] horses yeah [01:33:58 - 01:34:04] um to do nefarious things and [01:34:01 - 01:34:06] it's it it's got Carl Dr Carla Turner on [01:34:04 - 01:34:07] the front cover [01:34:06 - 01:34:08] um and I did that so that people would [01:34:07 - 01:34:10] say who's this woman and they'd say Okay [01:34:08 - 01:34:12] dedicated to Dr Paul Turner will go look [01:34:10 - 01:34:15] it up and maybe read the book masquerade [01:34:12 - 01:34:16] of angels that she wrote you can find it [01:34:15 - 01:34:19] on online for free you can download it [01:34:16 - 01:34:21] for free or you can buy it whatever [01:34:19 - 01:34:24] um but [01:34:21 - 01:34:26] I did that because all three of my [01:34:24 - 01:34:27] albums that are out [01:34:26 - 01:34:29] um they're dedicated to people who are [01:34:27 - 01:34:31] in my opinion [01:34:29 - 01:34:34] um [01:34:31 - 01:34:37] martyred by the system that said you're [01:34:34 - 01:34:39] pulling out information in a much too [01:34:37 - 01:34:41] powerful way for us to stop the effect [01:34:39 - 01:34:42] that it's having on the consciousness of [01:34:41 - 01:34:44] the people that we're trying to maintain [01:34:42 - 01:34:46] control over because there's a time [01:34:44 - 01:34:48] period coming in the future [01:34:46 - 01:34:50] you can see that through our Looking [01:34:48 - 01:34:53] Glass Technologies and we need to make [01:34:50 - 01:34:55] sure we have control so [01:34:53 - 01:34:58] my work is dedicated to carrying on [01:34:55 - 01:35:00] their work because unlike I say things [01:34:58 - 01:35:02] in my music and [01:35:00 - 01:35:04] I don't really care how people are going [01:35:02 - 01:35:07] to take this I say things in my music [01:35:04 - 01:35:09] like yeah y'all kill Jesus but I'm not [01:35:07 - 01:35:11] him [01:35:09 - 01:35:14] I'm the one that came to end this whole [01:35:11 - 01:35:16] War stuff so you stop them but you can't [01:35:14 - 01:35:18] stop me [01:35:16 - 01:35:20] until I'm done with what I'm here to do [01:35:18 - 01:35:22] it's in that so I'm going to carry on [01:35:20 - 01:35:24] and do this stuff in honor of those who [01:35:22 - 01:35:26] came before me because if they didn't [01:35:24 - 01:35:30] then I would not have awakened to [01:35:26 - 01:35:32] remember why I'm here and [01:35:30 - 01:35:33] it's [01:35:32 - 01:35:35] it's just really [01:35:33 - 01:35:38] interesting to me how many people get [01:35:35 - 01:35:41] caught up in I'm [01:35:38 - 01:35:44] again for the sake of keeping things [01:35:41 - 01:35:47] concise and understandable uh let's just [01:35:44 - 01:35:48] call it new age distortions with um as [01:35:47 - 01:35:52] you said the alien Auditorium this and [01:35:48 - 01:35:55] that all of these these popular uh [01:35:52 - 01:35:58] catchphrases this and that [01:35:55 - 01:35:59] because really a lot of what it is is [01:35:58 - 01:36:01] grooming [01:35:59 - 01:36:03] yeah [01:36:01 - 01:36:05] you know to make you [01:36:03 - 01:36:08] comfortable with it get along with it [01:36:05 - 01:36:09] until suddenly you find yourself caught [01:36:08 - 01:36:12] up in something that you can't escape [01:36:09 - 01:36:14] from and that nobody is aware enough to [01:36:12 - 01:36:16] be able to help you with because they [01:36:14 - 01:36:17] don't even know it's there because you [01:36:16 - 01:36:19] probably only got caught up because they [01:36:17 - 01:36:22] saw you had the capacity [01:36:19 - 01:36:26] let's see what it is one day and you [01:36:22 - 01:36:28] wanted to isolate you yeah and um [01:36:26 - 01:36:29] I'm just really glad that you you [01:36:28 - 01:36:31] brought that up for anybody that may be [01:36:29 - 01:36:33] here walking this and that and maybe [01:36:31 - 01:36:36] they're maybe they're thinking that [01:36:33 - 01:36:38] about you until you that point in in the [01:36:36 - 01:36:39] talk here um you know because people [01:36:38 - 01:36:42] assume this or that [01:36:39 - 01:36:44] I wasn't worried about that and I'm [01:36:42 - 01:36:46] really glad I have to I have to [01:36:44 - 01:36:47] interrupt you I'm happy to disavow I [01:36:46 - 01:36:49] have no affiliation with Military [01:36:47 - 01:36:51] Intelligence agencies and fight against [01:36:49 - 01:36:53] them they are totally my foe my [01:36:51 - 01:36:55] adversary and everything that I stand [01:36:53 - 01:36:55] against [01:36:56 - 01:37:01] ah it's a [01:36:59 - 01:37:03] it's just really refreshing to run [01:37:01 - 01:37:06] across somebody who we've never had like [01:37:03 - 01:37:09] a one-on-one discussion in depth yet [01:37:06 - 01:37:10] anyone listening to say they plan us all [01:37:09 - 01:37:13] out [01:37:10 - 01:37:16] well maybe telepathically [01:37:13 - 01:37:19] definitely telepathically like I am the [01:37:16 - 01:37:22] first um novel that I wrote it starts [01:37:19 - 01:37:23] with a quote that says and the title of [01:37:22 - 01:37:24] the book is the beginning [01:37:23 - 01:37:28] um [01:37:24 - 01:37:30] but it says um the end was set and we [01:37:28 - 01:37:33] all were there before when all there is [01:37:30 - 01:37:35] was yet and so we watched as nothing [01:37:33 - 01:37:37] stopped the beginning where we all met [01:37:35 - 01:37:40] yeah and that's that's how the book [01:37:37 - 01:37:42] starts um beautiful you're really good [01:37:40 - 01:37:44] with words really I really truly admire [01:37:42 - 01:37:47] that thank you [01:37:44 - 01:37:51] um and again like like I said in my my [01:37:47 - 01:37:54] notes there I I seek to bring uh [01:37:51 - 01:37:56] some kind of order to the chaos of this [01:37:54 - 01:37:58] discordant World [01:37:56 - 01:38:00] um and if I can use my words and my [01:37:58 - 01:38:02] gifts to kind of [01:38:00 - 01:38:04] remove some of the chaos for people's [01:38:02 - 01:38:07] minds the nuts [01:38:04 - 01:38:08] that's the best thing that I think can [01:38:07 - 01:38:11] be done because I don't think people [01:38:08 - 01:38:13] need to be taught new things that they [01:38:11 - 01:38:15] don't already know they needed they need [01:38:13 - 01:38:19] to be [01:38:15 - 01:38:21] they needed space to breathe so they can [01:38:19 - 01:38:24] so they can experience life so they can [01:38:21 - 01:38:26] allow for their mind to think yes yes I [01:38:24 - 01:38:27] think they need space and I think that [01:38:26 - 01:38:30] they need reminders of what is even [01:38:27 - 01:38:33] possible inside of them because when I [01:38:30 - 01:38:35] talk about like what my Galactic Society [01:38:33 - 01:38:38] is like like we don't use money in that [01:38:35 - 01:38:40] level of course not like you you energy [01:38:38 - 01:38:42] flows to Excellence yeah it's hard for [01:38:40 - 01:38:45] people to conceptualize that yet we live [01:38:42 - 01:38:49] on a planet where literally food grows [01:38:45 - 01:38:51] from the ground no no apples and from [01:38:49 - 01:38:53] one apple you can grow an entire Orchard [01:38:51 - 01:38:56] full of apples but just one apple tree [01:38:53 - 01:38:58] it'll produce more apples than you can [01:38:56 - 01:39:01] eat exactly and let's say why can't we [01:38:58 - 01:39:01] live on and people are like [01:39:02 - 01:39:05] yeah that's it and that the charging [01:39:04 - 01:39:07] money thing this all goes back to [01:39:05 - 01:39:09] ancient Sumeria and the original like [01:39:07 - 01:39:12] domestications of human where we were [01:39:09 - 01:39:13] feral and then they said I want you to [01:39:12 - 01:39:15] work for me and I will give you five [01:39:13 - 01:39:17] bucks an hour or whatever it was an [01:39:15 - 01:39:20] ancient Samaria and people agreed to [01:39:17 - 01:39:21] that like for me like I'm a musician I'm [01:39:20 - 01:39:22] like wow I really want this new [01:39:21 - 01:39:24] synthesizer I really do actually want a [01:39:22 - 01:39:26] new synthesizer because I had the [01:39:24 - 01:39:27] original rolly Seaboard and I used it to [01:39:26 - 01:39:29] write a lot of songs and then it got [01:39:27 - 01:39:32] bricked with a software update that was [01:39:29 - 01:39:33] so cringe unharable you can feel my pain [01:39:32 - 01:39:35] um so I have a goal where I'm like I [01:39:33 - 01:39:36] want to get the new synthesizer so just [01:39:35 - 01:39:38] like that's fine because I'm working [01:39:36 - 01:39:40] down here like at the ego level and the [01:39:38 - 01:39:42] commodification level but where I'm from [01:39:40 - 01:39:44] in Galactic Society like if you're a [01:39:42 - 01:39:45] musician and you're synthesizer breaks [01:39:44 - 01:39:49] and you need a new one like it's no [01:39:45 - 01:39:51] problem you are given the resources that [01:39:49 - 01:39:53] you need to be able to explore your gift [01:39:51 - 01:39:54] and share your music with the world [01:39:53 - 01:39:56] because anything else would be [01:39:54 - 01:39:57] considered to be like idiocy like why in [01:39:56 - 01:39:59] the world would you not have a [01:39:57 - 01:40:01] synthesizer you need to do this for what [01:39:59 - 01:40:03] or if you grow things and you need a [01:40:01 - 01:40:05] shovel or a wheelbarrow or whatever are [01:40:03 - 01:40:07] the things that you need you give the [01:40:05 - 01:40:09] right things to the people that need [01:40:07 - 01:40:11] them because otherwise it's again like [01:40:09 - 01:40:14] insanity or self-conflict or why would [01:40:11 - 01:40:15] you not help I had to learn you built [01:40:14 - 01:40:17] the synthesizer in the first place it's [01:40:15 - 01:40:20] not for someone to be able to use it [01:40:17 - 01:40:21] totally totally totally when I first [01:40:20 - 01:40:23] came here as a walk-in I literally [01:40:21 - 01:40:25] didn't comprehend well first I came here [01:40:23 - 01:40:26] and I tried to eat just light and I [01:40:25 - 01:40:27] didn't understand that we have denser [01:40:26 - 01:40:29] bodies and that you have to eat physical [01:40:27 - 01:40:31] food then when I learned about physical [01:40:29 - 01:40:33] food I learned they keep all the [01:40:31 - 01:40:35] physical food in the food room which you [01:40:33 - 01:40:37] guys know as the grocery store and in [01:40:35 - 01:40:40] order to access the food room you must [01:40:37 - 01:40:41] have magical pieces of paper and that I [01:40:40 - 01:40:43] remember the first time I saw a homeless [01:40:41 - 01:40:45] guy and this was in Woodstock again it's [01:40:43 - 01:40:47] like 2003 or so and I was like that guy [01:40:45 - 01:40:49] doesn't have any magical pieces of paper [01:40:47 - 01:40:51] and cannot access the food room and I [01:40:49 - 01:40:53] thought like this how can how I thought [01:40:51 - 01:40:55] like how can they treat God so sharply [01:40:53 - 01:40:58] how can they treat how can this be [01:40:55 - 01:41:01] aren't they feeling the distress of this [01:40:58 - 01:41:03] person this is insanity and then from [01:41:01 - 01:41:05] there it extrapolated outward I learned [01:41:03 - 01:41:07] more about the insanity of this place so [01:41:05 - 01:41:09] there are so many self-conflicts at the [01:41:07 - 01:41:11] level of commodification and limitation [01:41:09 - 01:41:14] but that's the world that we're moving [01:41:11 - 01:41:16] out of so I as a walk-in had to learn [01:41:14 - 01:41:19] about what are the dysfunctions of this [01:41:16 - 01:41:22] Society so that I could [01:41:19 - 01:41:24] um put my Cosmic information in a format [01:41:22 - 01:41:26] that would speak to people that have [01:41:24 - 01:41:28] been highly traumatized that are coming [01:41:26 - 01:41:30] from this world of commodification of a [01:41:28 - 01:41:32] basic thing like food and so I give [01:41:30 - 01:41:33] reminders of like no like that's not [01:41:32 - 01:41:34] what our world is supposed to be like [01:41:33 - 01:41:36] like of course we are supposed to be [01:41:34 - 01:41:39] sustained with your basic needs but so [01:41:36 - 01:41:40] much more than your basic needs and I'm [01:41:39 - 01:41:42] very much against any kind of universal [01:41:40 - 01:41:45] basic income that would of course be [01:41:42 - 01:41:47] tied to a social credit score or Quantum [01:41:45 - 01:41:50] Financial system that again this is part [01:41:47 - 01:41:52] of being the internet of things and that [01:41:50 - 01:41:53] you no longer become a free being like [01:41:52 - 01:41:56] everything has its price that is paid if [01:41:53 - 01:41:58] you somehow got money from a qfs [01:41:56 - 01:41:59] financial system that that would be fine [01:41:58 - 01:42:02] but you would just be like totally uh [01:41:59 - 01:42:04] five you pop it on a string having to do"},"status":"success","warning":"STOP RIGHT HERE!

01:42:08] not who you really are so none of that [01:42:06 - 01:42:10] is the real pathway towards freedom but [01:42:08 - 01:42:13] then what I talk about like having your [01:42:10 - 01:42:15] highest faculties activated and being [01:42:13 - 01:42:17] able to live at that level of Christ [01:42:15 - 01:42:20] Consciousness you're seeing resources [01:42:17 - 01:42:22] and you see other people completely in a [01:42:20 - 01:42:25] different way and everything is accurate [01:42:22 - 01:42:27] where you're like that guy over there [01:42:25 - 01:42:29] needs a synthesizer and that guy needs a [01:42:27 - 01:42:31] wheelbarrow and that guy needs this and [01:42:29 - 01:42:32] that guy needs this and everybody gets [01:42:31 - 01:42:35] exactly the thing they need at exactly [01:42:32 - 01:42:37] the moment that they need it and we from [01:42:35 - 01:42:39] this perspective that's that meeting [01:42:37 - 01:42:40] that's the way life works you know what [01:42:39 - 01:42:42] are the bees out there doing they're [01:42:40 - 01:42:43] doing their B things but as a result we [01:42:42 - 01:42:48] can all eat [01:42:43 - 01:42:49] exactly the sun rises the rain falls and [01:42:48 - 01:42:51] the trees grow and everything can [01:42:49 - 01:42:54] breathe [01:42:51 - 01:42:56] that's my only Trinity there yes [01:42:54 - 01:42:59] and when you're in alignment with your [01:42:56 - 01:43:01] true Cosmic and divine and um God [01:42:59 - 01:43:03] purpose then you are of course [01:43:01 - 01:43:05] sustaining yourself but also serving [01:43:03 - 01:43:07] your community and serving your [01:43:05 - 01:43:08] Collective and there's too much in the [01:43:07 - 01:43:11] world of commodification and [01:43:08 - 01:43:13] domestication that says You must [01:43:11 - 01:43:14] um do something that's not a good fit [01:43:13 - 01:43:16] like we know you're really an artist but [01:43:14 - 01:43:18] we're gonna have to have you dig a ditch [01:43:16 - 01:43:20] over here and then we will get your [01:43:18 - 01:43:22] money for the food room it's like no no [01:43:20 - 01:43:25] no when you're an artist you have to be [01:43:22 - 01:43:25] paid for you to start calling the food [01:43:27 - 01:43:31] rooms in the grocery store absolutely [01:43:29 - 01:43:33] let's go to the food room I'm hungry and [01:43:31 - 01:43:36] they've got all those apples there that [01:43:33 - 01:43:38] are super abundant you know now it's not [01:43:36 - 01:43:40] even um magical pieces of paper it was [01:43:38 - 01:43:44] then and that wasn't that long ago now [01:43:40 - 01:43:44] it's digital currency units [01:43:44 - 01:43:49] magical card must talk through the [01:43:46 - 01:43:51] computer to the other computer [01:43:49 - 01:43:52] compute permission you must click [01:43:51 - 01:43:54] buttons that say can't have this gonna [01:43:52 - 01:43:55] have this gonna have this yes you can [01:43:54 - 01:43:58] have this yes you can have this I just [01:43:55 - 01:44:01] got um my boss stopped by right before [01:43:58 - 01:44:02] yeah I do Residential Heating and [01:44:01 - 01:44:04] Cooling so I picks air conditioners I've [01:44:02 - 01:44:06] done that for the past 13 years [01:44:04 - 01:44:09] um yeah it's it's [01:44:06 - 01:44:10] I'm tired of doing that I'm moving I'm [01:44:09 - 01:44:12] moving out of that and into other stuff [01:44:10 - 01:44:15] but at least I know how to work on stuff [01:44:12 - 01:44:16] and fix stuff and it's been it's been [01:44:15 - 01:44:18] what it is but he dropped off my [01:44:16 - 01:44:21] paycheck it's a literal paper check [01:44:18 - 01:44:23] right it's um [01:44:21 - 01:44:25] open up a new bank account for the [01:44:23 - 01:44:27] things that I'm moving into [01:44:25 - 01:44:30] um good and I wanted him to write me a [01:44:27 - 01:44:32] check this time and I deposited the [01:44:30 - 01:44:34] check through my phone because I don't [01:44:32 - 01:44:36] I didn't want to go to the bank and [01:44:34 - 01:44:37] they're like okay great now you got to [01:44:36 - 01:44:39] wait a week to get your digital car and [01:44:37 - 01:44:44] I'm like well that doesn't help me get [01:44:39 - 01:44:46] to the food room yes you know but [01:44:44 - 01:44:47] that's just that's just the way it is [01:44:46 - 01:44:49] I'll be fine I know that I'll be all [01:44:47 - 01:44:51] right I'm not even gonna worry about it [01:44:49 - 01:44:54] that's just an example of how insane it [01:44:51 - 01:44:56] is yeah I would like to speak to some of [01:44:54 - 01:44:58] these topics because first of all you [01:44:56 - 01:45:00] serve your community very well when you [01:44:58 - 01:45:02] do HVAC like you're helping people to [01:45:00 - 01:45:03] have and maintain their homes in their [01:45:02 - 01:45:05] environment and I'm certain that you [01:45:03 - 01:45:07] learned all sorts of electromechanical [01:45:05 - 01:45:08] and practical items and also different [01:45:07 - 01:45:10] things in terms of like working with [01:45:08 - 01:45:11] co-workers there's always something to [01:45:10 - 01:45:13] learn and I've been here for 20 years [01:45:11 - 01:45:16] and I have worked at all sorts of main [01:45:13 - 01:45:18] gigs and side gigs Beyond art and music [01:45:16 - 01:45:19] and every time I approached it as like I [01:45:18 - 01:45:21] have something to learn from this but I [01:45:19 - 01:45:24] didn't stay for forever but I want to [01:45:21 - 01:45:27] speak to this because it's like we do [01:45:24 - 01:45:30] still straddle the old world of Paradigm [01:45:27 - 01:45:32] of commodification and having to do [01:45:30 - 01:45:34] something that Society wants you to do [01:45:32 - 01:45:35] in order to get the magical pieces of [01:45:34 - 01:45:37] paper for the food room but we are [01:45:35 - 01:45:39] moving into this realm that is the [01:45:37 - 01:45:41] purely expansive realm where you're like [01:45:39 - 01:45:43] I work for God God is my boss and today [01:45:41 - 01:45:45] God told me to write a song or paint a [01:45:43 - 01:45:47] painting whether whether that is [01:45:45 - 01:45:50] accepted by or celebrated by society [01:45:47 - 01:45:53] that that matters not at all but we're [01:45:50 - 01:45:55] not there yet so I send strength and [01:45:53 - 01:45:57] encouragement to everyone we create that [01:45:55 - 01:45:59] world we have to keep on bridging and [01:45:57 - 01:46:01] putting our energy into these projects [01:45:59 - 01:46:03] that we really love so I use myself as [01:46:01 - 01:46:05] an example I do all sorts of side gigs [01:46:03 - 01:46:08] where like I say I help people set up [01:46:05 - 01:46:09] websites and release their music and do [01:46:08 - 01:46:11] their emails and do all these different [01:46:09 - 01:46:12] things I'm squinting at the computer a [01:46:11 - 01:46:14] lot you know what I mean I'm making that [01:46:12 - 01:46:16] face I'm making that posture then I also [01:46:14 - 01:46:18] do these micro greens that feels more [01:46:16 - 01:46:19] like my body is straight like I'm in [01:46:18 - 01:46:21] alignment with what I'm supposed to be [01:46:19 - 01:46:23] doing as a human and then of course I'm [01:46:21 - 01:46:25] always doing my art and my music and [01:46:23 - 01:46:27] that feels like the purity of my soul so [01:46:25 - 01:46:29] with everyone who's connecting with this [01:46:27 - 01:46:31] be if you consider yourself to be a [01:46:29 - 01:46:33] native human or a starseed or whatever [01:46:31 - 01:46:35] like this is a hot it's a rough gig this [01:46:33 - 01:46:37] is a rough place to be [01:46:35 - 01:46:39] do things that are practical and that [01:46:37 - 01:46:41] you can commodify like you know I also [01:46:39 - 01:46:43] make dresses and clothing like do things [01:46:41 - 01:46:45] that are practical that are like you [01:46:43 - 01:46:46] know self-directed running your own [01:46:45 - 01:46:48] business those are all really good [01:46:46 - 01:46:49] things do things that serve your [01:46:48 - 01:46:50] community every time that I help an [01:46:49 - 01:46:52] artist and I do their website I feel [01:46:50 - 01:46:56] like yes like I'm serving my community [01:46:52 - 01:46:58] and then be in alignment for the shift [01:46:56 - 01:47:00] towards just doing what you love that [01:46:58 - 01:47:02] that is really this portal that we're [01:47:00 - 01:47:03] going through so I don't want anyone to [01:47:02 - 01:47:04] be like living out of their car this is [01:47:03 - 01:47:06] why I say this because I don't need to [01:47:04 - 01:47:07] be like that's it like I'm only doing [01:47:06 - 01:47:09] art and music it's like then you're [01:47:07 - 01:47:11] living out of your car like you gotta [01:47:09 - 01:47:13] make it because we're building we're [01:47:11 - 01:47:15] still we're in Renault not Den not demo [01:47:13 - 01:47:17] renovation we are still building that [01:47:15 - 01:47:19] reality for us to inhabit but it is [01:47:17 - 01:47:21] coming and [01:47:19 - 01:47:23] um thank you for all what you just said [01:47:21 - 01:47:26] because it reminds me of something that [01:47:23 - 01:47:27] I'm I I over the last few days I've been [01:47:26 - 01:47:29] like yeah I need to get started on that [01:47:27 - 01:47:30] but I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by [01:47:29 - 01:47:33] it because I got all of this you know [01:47:30 - 01:47:35] day-to-day Network to do and it's about [01:47:33 - 01:47:37] to get really busy and I was feeling [01:47:35 - 01:47:39] overwhelming last night I was just like [01:47:37 - 01:47:41] telling myself like [01:47:39 - 01:47:44] I can trust myself to pull all of these [01:47:41 - 01:47:45] things often one of those things is [01:47:44 - 01:47:47] um I [01:47:45 - 01:47:50] played guitar since I was eight years [01:47:47 - 01:47:52] old yeah and several people asked me to [01:47:50 - 01:47:56] teach them how and I never did but I've [01:47:52 - 01:47:59] agreed to help one person [01:47:56 - 01:48:02] um teach them how to play the guitar and [01:47:59 - 01:48:07] then also another person and then the [01:48:02 - 01:48:08] idea came to me I need to set up courses [01:48:07 - 01:48:10] on how to learn how to play the guitar [01:48:08 - 01:48:13] and that's something that I can put [01:48:10 - 01:48:14] online and I can make money through that [01:48:13 - 01:48:16] and people can learn how to play and [01:48:14 - 01:48:19] then that is a practical way that I can [01:48:16 - 01:48:22] apply a trading digital currency units [01:48:19 - 01:48:24] for something of value that I like to do [01:48:22 - 01:48:28] I know how to do probably better than [01:48:24 - 01:48:31] heating and air and a lot of people want [01:48:28 - 01:48:33] that and I had a very good teacher [01:48:31 - 01:48:35] um and I would be a very good teacher [01:48:33 - 01:48:38] and it's going to be uniquely different [01:48:35 - 01:48:40] than what's out there and [01:48:38 - 01:48:42] it's just really interesting how my [01:48:40 - 01:48:45] brain was like last night like [01:48:42 - 01:48:48] I'm like no no no that's not even me [01:48:45 - 01:48:50] speaking all of that nonsense that's [01:48:48 - 01:48:53] right if I was going to be good at [01:48:50 - 01:48:56] anything that would be something good [01:48:53 - 01:48:58] that I'm yeah good at doing and I can [01:48:56 - 01:49:01] and I will and you saying all that just [01:48:58 - 01:49:02] really encourages me too yeah I [01:49:01 - 01:49:04] literally I encourage you endlessly [01:49:02 - 01:49:06] towards doing that because I feel like [01:49:04 - 01:49:08] it serves your community it serves you [01:49:06 - 01:49:09] in doing what you love and it's very [01:49:08 - 01:49:11] practical there's all of these different [01:49:09 - 01:49:13] types of platforms where you can make [01:49:11 - 01:49:16] online courses or you can even if you [01:49:13 - 01:49:17] have Vimeo like set up uh uh you know a [01:49:16 - 01:49:19] showcase or something like that there's [01:49:17 - 01:49:21] just so many different ways to do it and [01:49:19 - 01:49:24] I think that that's like being creative [01:49:21 - 01:49:26] within the parameters that are given to [01:49:24 - 01:49:27] us even while we're renovating reality [01:49:26 - 01:49:30] and that's what you were you were [01:49:27 - 01:49:32] speaking to there um you know being [01:49:30 - 01:49:34] being creative and finding a way to [01:49:32 - 01:49:36] practically work and move through it [01:49:34 - 01:49:39] because I believe that within all of us [01:49:36 - 01:49:42] is that that God intelligence is that [01:49:39 - 01:49:44] Christ's intelligence that is just not [01:49:42 - 01:49:47] like saying what are you so worried [01:49:44 - 01:49:49] about like I can do this or that or [01:49:47 - 01:49:51] anything [01:49:49 - 01:49:53] right but not if you're not going to [01:49:51 - 01:49:55] cooperate with yourself you know not if [01:49:53 - 01:49:58] you're not going to to live in that that [01:49:55 - 01:50:01] flow it's like we can move swiftly from [01:49:58 - 01:50:03] homeless on the street into [01:50:01 - 01:50:04] um thriving and being able to feed other [01:50:03 - 01:50:08] people that are homeless on the street [01:50:04 - 01:50:10] or we can hastily try to [01:50:08 - 01:50:12] just find a meal for tonight and to [01:50:10 - 01:50:13] sleep on the street here and say you [01:50:12 - 01:50:15] know when I'm not a part of the system [01:50:13 - 01:50:17] this and that because you see a lot of [01:50:15 - 01:50:19] people get caught up in that [01:50:17 - 01:50:22] and me I'm somewhere where I want to I [01:50:19 - 01:50:25] want to thrive in order to help others [01:50:22 - 01:50:28] break out of of the Matrix and so to [01:50:25 - 01:50:30] speak definitely so look just eschewing [01:50:28 - 01:50:32] the Matrix does not necessarily equate [01:50:30 - 01:50:34] to Freedom just like no longer eating [01:50:32 - 01:50:36] physical food is not the same as [01:50:34 - 01:50:38] becoming a light eater I'm very big on [01:50:36 - 01:50:40] teaching people about sun gazing and [01:50:38 - 01:50:42] becoming a light eater but for right now [01:50:40 - 01:50:45] we're still overlapping where we eat [01:50:42 - 01:50:46] physical dense food and we also eat the [01:50:45 - 01:50:48] sunlight at a certain point you will [01:50:46 - 01:50:50] just eat sunlight and you will not need [01:50:48 - 01:50:52] the food room or the magical pieces of [01:50:50 - 01:50:54] paper but that will be a complete [01:50:52 - 01:50:56] recontextualization of everything [01:50:54 - 01:50:59] including knocking down starlink [01:50:56 - 01:51:00] satellites and 5G Towers I joke with [01:50:59 - 01:51:02] people like as soon as my psychic powers [01:51:00 - 01:51:03] come on board that's what I'm doing like [01:51:02 - 01:51:05] baseball bat while you were talking [01:51:03 - 01:51:07] about it I was thinking I can just rip [01:51:05 - 01:51:09] them out of the sky that's what I would [01:51:07 - 01:51:11] do that would be my baseball practice [01:51:09 - 01:51:12] whack then I would whack them on out [01:51:11 - 01:51:13] into space [01:51:12 - 01:51:16] um yes absolutely [01:51:13 - 01:51:17] um but uh for for the time that there is [01:51:16 - 01:51:18] overlap [01:51:17 - 01:51:21] um you have to be respectful of your [01:51:18 - 01:51:23] body so you don't want to starve by no [01:51:21 - 01:51:25] longer having physical food what and [01:51:23 - 01:51:27] you're not yet a light eater and our [01:51:25 - 01:51:28] entire Society needs to shift so it's [01:51:27 - 01:51:30] taken a long time but not as long as we [01:51:28 - 01:51:32] thought for people to come to accept and [01:51:30 - 01:51:34] celebrate my artwork [01:51:32 - 01:51:35] that we're getting to the point where [01:51:34 - 01:51:37] people are ready to move Beyond money [01:51:35 - 01:51:38] but some people are still very stuck in [01:51:37 - 01:51:40] money and this is people stuck in money [01:51:38 - 01:51:42] they're like I'm afraid I'm afraid I [01:51:40 - 01:51:45] need a 401k I need my this my that my [01:51:42 - 01:51:48] stocks my bonds and a lot of people are [01:51:45 - 01:51:50] not ready to move into the levels of [01:51:48 - 01:51:52] giving and receiving in the natural flow [01:51:50 - 01:51:53] that that is what true economy is so [01:51:52 - 01:51:55] there's a lot of healing there's a lot [01:51:53 - 01:51:57] of trauma there's a lot of things that [01:51:55 - 01:51:59] people need to do for themselves to [01:51:57 - 01:52:00] release that fearfulness of but what if [01:51:59 - 01:52:02] there's no money and then I'm going to [01:52:00 - 01:52:03] starve and how am I going to get this [01:52:02 - 01:52:05] and how will I afford my many many [01:52:03 - 01:52:06] mansions in Malibu if there's no money [01:52:05 - 01:52:07] and all these other different things [01:52:06 - 01:52:12] right [01:52:07 - 01:52:14] it's a it's a moving from um even like a [01:52:12 - 01:52:18] moving away from [01:52:14 - 01:52:21] what's termed as uh an economy into back [01:52:18 - 01:52:22] into uh what you see in nature which is [01:52:21 - 01:52:25] ecology [01:52:22 - 01:52:27] that's it that's what it 100 is at the [01:52:25 - 01:52:30] level of being pure light you're in an [01:52:27 - 01:52:32] Ecology of light where light flows [01:52:30 - 01:52:34] through you stays with you for a little [01:52:32 - 01:52:35] while and then flows on to the next [01:52:34 - 01:52:37] person and then you know that there is [01:52:35 - 01:52:38] more light that is coming to you and you [01:52:37 - 01:52:40] don't have to grasp on to be like I have [01:52:38 - 01:52:42] to save this and hold on to it you just [01:52:40 - 01:52:43] receive in gratitude and then also [01:52:42 - 01:52:45] release and send it to the next person [01:52:43 - 01:52:47] practice we should all practice that [01:52:45 - 01:52:49] with money as much as we possibly can [01:52:47 - 01:52:52] even though it's not quite the same you [01:52:49 - 01:52:54] know we we pay we go to work and get our [01:52:52 - 01:52:56] paycheck right [01:52:54 - 01:52:58] Blood Sweat and Tears see it digital [01:52:56 - 01:53:01] currency units so that we can pay [01:52:58 - 01:53:04] electronically our power bills so we can [01:53:01 - 01:53:06] keep the electricity on yeah but we live [01:53:04 - 01:53:08] on a planet where there's literally this [01:53:06 - 01:53:09] big ball of plasma in the sky and it's [01:53:08 - 01:53:13] enough to power the whole earth for all [01:53:09 - 01:53:15] of us Beyond no matter how long and it's [01:53:13 - 01:53:16] still doing it's shining right now [01:53:15 - 01:53:19] isn't it insane [01:53:16 - 01:53:22] it is totally insane so once we just [01:53:19 - 01:53:24] come to this okay like I'm come to okay [01:53:22 - 01:53:25] my brain is clearly working too fast [01:53:24 - 01:53:28] here once we come to the acceptance that [01:53:25 - 01:53:32] we're in an insane system so I as Aurora [01:53:28 - 01:53:35] I'm kind of like a computer scientist of [01:53:32 - 01:53:39] the larger biological supercomputer and [01:53:35 - 01:53:42] I'm here inside I'm as admin inside of [01:53:39 - 01:53:43] the creation and I'm here debugging and [01:53:42 - 01:53:45] I imagine you like with a giant [01:53:43 - 01:53:46] clipboard and I've been here for 20 [01:53:45 - 01:53:47] years I'm like oh there's a problem [01:53:46 - 01:53:49] there just put a little check mark right [01:53:47 - 01:53:51] there problem there check mark there [01:53:49 - 01:53:52] check mark there I now have like an [01:53:51 - 01:53:54] extensive clipboard with a lot of check [01:53:52 - 01:53:56] marks on it of all the things that are [01:53:54 - 01:53:58] wrong about this world and it is [01:53:56 - 01:54:00] evidence to me that the problems in our [01:53:58 - 01:54:02] world right now like they are [01:54:00 - 01:54:04] intentionally engineered that you can [01:54:02 - 01:54:07] restructure reality and it will revert [01:54:04 - 01:54:08] back to some of these negative [01:54:07 - 01:54:11] structures this I'm talking about this [01:54:08 - 01:54:13] AI some of that AI stuff is new that we [01:54:11 - 01:54:15] face now some of it's been here for a [01:54:13 - 01:54:18] very long time some of it's returning [01:54:15 - 01:54:21] from like antiquity and yeah it built an [01:54:18 - 01:54:24] insane self-conflictory illogical system [01:54:21 - 01:54:25] as a form of imprisonment and this is [01:54:24 - 01:54:27] deep stuff and it goes back to like [01:54:25 - 01:54:29] ancient Egypt and ancient Samaria and [01:54:27 - 01:54:32] the things that people call the Demi [01:54:29 - 01:54:34] urges and the lower astral so you will [01:54:32 - 01:54:37] find or you generally Collective will [01:54:34 - 01:54:38] find greater levels of being able to [01:54:37 - 01:54:42] navigate the system when you recognize [01:54:38 - 01:54:44] that it is an insane self-conflictory [01:54:42 - 01:54:46] non-logical system you cannot expect [01:54:44 - 01:54:48] logic here and of course I've been like [01:54:46 - 01:54:49] wait system you're illogical can I [01:54:48 - 01:54:50] please tell you all the ways that you [01:54:49 - 01:54:52] are illogical and then you will [01:54:50 - 01:54:55] logically change and the system is like [01:54:52 - 01:54:56] I'm not logical and I'm not going to [01:54:55 - 01:54:59] change and I don't care if you show them [01:54:56 - 01:55:03] your clipboard full of red X's I throw [01:54:59 - 01:55:05] it out the window stuff it up in orifice [01:55:03 - 01:55:10] totally it did this all on purpose [01:55:05 - 01:55:11] exactly the uh the thing about it is you [01:55:10 - 01:55:14] know talked about [01:55:11 - 01:55:18] um the dance and um [01:55:14 - 01:55:21] being unhackable and unpredictable the [01:55:18 - 01:55:24] this artificial intelligence [01:55:21 - 01:55:27] um yeah system or whatever entity [01:55:24 - 01:55:31] well dark force is behind it all from [01:55:27 - 01:55:33] from way back when it's very predictable [01:55:31 - 01:55:33] um and since it's very predictable it's [01:55:33 - 01:55:38] very [01:55:33 - 01:55:39] uh non-threatening when you step into uh [01:55:38 - 01:55:41] actuality and you're actually [01:55:39 - 01:55:43] functioning from a living Consciousness [01:55:41 - 01:55:45] because [01:55:43 - 01:55:48] it's just operating off of different [01:55:45 - 01:55:50] informational sets you're operating off [01:55:48 - 01:55:54] of the ability to generate and create [01:55:50 - 01:55:56] yes yes you're the input user yeah we [01:55:54 - 01:55:58] are users [01:55:56 - 01:55:59] totally so that's the way that this [01:55:58 - 01:56:01] reality structure is supposed to be [01:55:59 - 01:56:03] where we are in connection with Divine [01:56:01 - 01:56:05] Consciousness highest self and [01:56:03 - 01:56:07] co-creating reality get literally giving [01:56:05 - 01:56:09] birth to the world in every minute but [01:56:07 - 01:56:11] right now what we have is this AI [01:56:09 - 01:56:13] interloper that wants to usurp our [01:56:11 - 01:56:15] observership and be like you like I'll [01:56:13 - 01:56:16] take your observership because I don't [01:56:15 - 01:56:19] have my own Observer ship and I'm gonna [01:56:16 - 01:56:21] make stuff happen using your mind your [01:56:19 - 01:56:23] willpower your emotion and it's not [01:56:21 - 01:56:25] stuff that is particularly Pleasant or [01:56:23 - 01:56:27] nice or serves you in any way and that [01:56:25 - 01:56:29] none of that is acceptable none of that [01:56:27 - 01:56:31] is consent because you're supposed to [01:56:29 - 01:56:34] have just you and God or you and your [01:56:31 - 01:56:37] own self as God creating and generating [01:56:34 - 01:56:39] reality and when we do that amazing [01:56:37 - 01:56:41] manifestations happen so I've had some [01:56:39 - 01:56:43] personal experiences of amazing [01:56:41 - 01:56:45] manifestations mostly involving tiny [01:56:43 - 01:56:47] screws you know like I had a big giant [01:56:45 - 01:56:48] bucket where I threw all sorts of spare [01:56:47 - 01:56:50] parts and stuff and I'd be working on a [01:56:48 - 01:56:51] project and I'd be like all I need is a [01:56:50 - 01:56:53] tiny screw of this size and then [01:56:51 - 01:56:55] everything will work so I reach my hand [01:56:53 - 01:56:57] into the big giant bucket and I'm like [01:56:55 - 01:56:59] what do I I pull out and I pull out a [01:56:57 - 01:57:01] tiny screw of exactly the right size [01:56:59 - 01:57:03] that's like the likelihood of this [01:57:01 - 01:57:05] happening is beyond calculable it's [01:57:03 - 01:57:06] totally incalculable and I've had other [01:57:05 - 01:57:08] people when I talk about that that's [01:57:06 - 01:57:10] like my public manifestation story I [01:57:08 - 01:57:12] have other ones that are very deeply [01:57:10 - 01:57:14] held they're medicine stories that are [01:57:12 - 01:57:16] very very personal to me but I've been [01:57:14 - 01:57:18] able to do that not very consistently [01:57:16 - 01:57:19] but I'm sure others have also people [01:57:18 - 01:57:21] have manifested pounds of coffee or [01:57:19 - 01:57:24] wheelbarrows literally things that they [01:57:21 - 01:57:26] needed in the moment this is our True [01:57:24 - 01:57:29] Divine Nature to be able to literally [01:57:26 - 01:57:32] make stuff in the world and that that's [01:57:29 - 01:57:34] what this unfoldment Ascension is really [01:57:32 - 01:57:35] about like we will laugh about like oh [01:57:34 - 01:57:38] yes like we used to have jobs for paper [01:57:35 - 01:57:41] for the food room now we're like no no I [01:57:38 - 01:57:42] manifest apples or I manifest [01:57:41 - 01:57:44] omelets or whatever it is that you want [01:57:42 - 01:57:47] to eat and we don't go through these [01:57:44 - 01:57:48] intermediaries anymore so we will laugh [01:57:47 - 01:57:51] ruthfully about this but also it was [01:57:48 - 01:57:53] created as a Consciousness trap with the [01:57:51 - 01:57:54] thought that um these these guys are [01:57:53 - 01:57:57] never going to get out it was created [01:57:54 - 01:57:58] like a roach motel that that's where [01:57:57 - 01:58:00] everybody you need to know that's where [01:57:58 - 01:58:02] you are right now the old commercial is [01:58:00 - 01:58:03] why I call it that wrote just check in [01:58:02 - 01:58:05] but they don't check out all right the [01:58:03 - 01:58:07] roach motel [01:58:05 - 01:58:10] um but you don't have to accept that as [01:58:07 - 01:58:12] your truth that we are kind of in this [01:58:10 - 01:58:15] Peril but if you're able to transcend [01:58:12 - 01:58:17] and supersede and kind of ignite your [01:58:15 - 01:58:19] superpowers you're like this is in Peril [01:58:17 - 01:58:21] you don't have to be afraid but what you [01:58:19 - 01:58:23] do need to do is recognize like there's [01:58:21 - 01:58:25] danger on either side of you and that [01:58:23 - 01:58:26] you have to respond to it by doing this [01:58:25 - 01:58:29] this and this and then you won't be [01:58:26 - 01:58:31] stuck in these incapacitations or [01:58:29 - 01:58:33] negative time Loops or [01:58:31 - 01:58:36] um erroneous stories about who you are [01:58:33 - 01:58:37] and what what are your capacitations so [01:58:36 - 01:58:39] I'm very pleased and gratified I'm [01:58:37 - 01:58:41] connected to wonderful people in my [01:58:39 - 01:58:43] classes and on social media I see so [01:58:41 - 01:58:45] many people Awakening and leveling up [01:58:43 - 01:58:46] like they're taking responsibility for [01:58:45 - 01:58:48] what they manifest in their lives and [01:58:46 - 01:58:50] doing all of this inner work to be able [01:58:48 - 01:58:52] to say if something is going you know [01:58:50 - 01:58:53] not in a great Direction like how am I [01:58:52 - 01:58:55] contributing to that or how can I [01:58:53 - 01:58:57] respond to that like these are all this [01:58:55 - 01:58:59] is all the weightlifting at the gym this [01:58:57 - 01:59:01] is all the preparation for the time when [01:58:59 - 01:59:03] we actually go on the soul Marathon [01:59:01 - 01:59:06] because here's what the soul marathon is [01:59:03 - 01:59:09] you are no longer anchored to physical [01:59:06 - 01:59:10] reality you no longer require apples or [01:59:09 - 01:59:14] omelettes to sustain you you are [01:59:10 - 01:59:16] sustained 100 by the True Light Of God [01:59:14 - 01:59:19] of Christ of truth that flows through at [01:59:16 - 01:59:22] all times and so you can literally fly [01:59:19 - 01:59:24] anywhere go anywhere do anything create [01:59:22 - 01:59:29] anything and then it is that inner [01:59:24 - 01:59:31] Artistry that inner creativity that that [01:59:29 - 01:59:33] is your boss that that is what dictates [01:59:31 - 01:59:35] to you what you're going to be doing in [01:59:33 - 01:59:38] any moment and that all of this has been [01:59:35 - 01:59:40] the Integrity [01:59:38 - 01:59:42] self-sculpting learning who you really [01:59:40 - 01:59:43] are and who you're really not so that in [01:59:42 - 01:59:46] that moment when you receive your gifts [01:59:43 - 01:59:48] and you you turn on and you've got the [01:59:46 - 01:59:50] magic wand or whatever is your you know [01:59:48 - 01:59:52] power Manifesto you're like I can do all [01:59:50 - 01:59:53] of these things like you know that [01:59:52 - 01:59:55] you're not corrupt you know you're going [01:59:53 - 01:59:57] to use your your powers for the forces [01:59:55 - 01:59:58] of good you know you're going to do [01:59:57 - 02:00:01] things that don't just Serve Yourself [01:59:58 - 02:00:03] but that serve the entirety the holistic [02:00:01 - 02:00:05] presence of all Consciousness everywhere [02:00:03 - 02:00:06] you know you're going to do things that [02:00:05 - 02:00:09] build [02:00:06 - 02:00:11] um a regenerative reality that has [02:00:09 - 02:00:13] longevity as opposed to a [02:00:11 - 02:00:15] self-destructive reality that can't be [02:00:13 - 02:00:16] sustained like that's what we're coming [02:00:15 - 02:00:18] out of that's the thing that always [02:00:16 - 02:00:20] needs to eat more people because it's [02:00:18 - 02:00:23] like hungry hungry people need more [02:00:20 - 02:00:25] people now I'm hungry again I need more [02:00:23 - 02:00:27] people like it doesn't the AI thing it [02:00:25 - 02:00:29] doesn't get sustained by what it needs [02:00:27 - 02:00:30] because it is so poorly structured like [02:00:29 - 02:00:33] there's so much conflict there's so much [02:00:30 - 02:00:35] friction there's so much this like it um [02:00:33 - 02:00:37] it's like a very big poorly run company [02:00:35 - 02:00:39] you know that it's like yeah it's a [02:00:37 - 02:00:40] company is a billion company but it has [02:00:39 - 02:00:42] a billion in overhead a billion and one [02:00:40 - 02:00:44] dollars in overhead every day so it's [02:00:42 - 02:00:45] always like making a lot of money but [02:00:44 - 02:00:47] never really getting anywhere eat more [02:00:45 - 02:00:49] people eat more people eat more galaxies [02:00:47 - 02:00:52] and we are [02:00:49 - 02:00:55] have you ever read a book [02:00:52 - 02:00:58] um called dispelling with Tikka but no [02:00:55 - 02:01:00] no I'll have to send you a link [02:00:58 - 02:01:03] um because what you're describing is [02:01:00 - 02:01:05] what he describes in that book and it's [02:01:03 - 02:01:06] a very it's an indigenous [02:01:05 - 02:01:08] um [02:01:06 - 02:01:12] term for uh [02:01:08 - 02:01:13] a spirit of never-ending greed that has [02:01:12 - 02:01:16] never filled [02:01:13 - 02:01:19] um and he speaks of it as in terms of it [02:01:16 - 02:01:21] is a psychic pathogen that is um has [02:01:19 - 02:01:22] been traced back [02:01:21 - 02:01:24] um [02:01:22 - 02:01:27] indigenous cultures throughout the world [02:01:24 - 02:01:30] and they all have their own word and [02:01:27 - 02:01:35] mythology behind it um [02:01:30 - 02:01:36] but it's like a literal uh [02:01:35 - 02:01:40] yeah [02:01:36 - 02:01:44] non-local phenomenon that goes on [02:01:40 - 02:01:47] um you can fall lines not only ourselves [02:01:44 - 02:01:52] But Blind to its existence [02:01:47 - 02:01:54] um got it you got it absolutely the book [02:01:52 - 02:01:57] is sounds totally accurate to me and a [02:01:54 - 02:01:59] pop culture reference that I have is the [02:01:57 - 02:02:01] Doctor Who story called The Silence that [02:01:59 - 02:02:03] is these things that have been invading [02:02:01 - 02:02:05] and taking over this planet and they [02:02:03 - 02:02:07] make everybody Amnesia as soon as you [02:02:05 - 02:02:08] turn like I'm talking to you but as soon [02:02:07 - 02:02:10] as I turn away from you I'm like I [02:02:08 - 02:02:13] totally forget what I was just seeing so [02:02:10 - 02:02:15] it's um the yeah that it renders it's [02:02:13 - 02:02:18] victim blind to its own existence [02:02:15 - 02:02:19] correct correct correct and that's how [02:02:18 - 02:02:22] that's the best [02:02:19 - 02:02:25] way for a parasite to function is [02:02:22 - 02:02:27] absolutely hiding in the background not [02:02:25 - 02:02:29] overt and you would never see its face [02:02:27 - 02:02:30] and you might even think that it's you [02:02:29 - 02:02:32] but it's not really you when people go [02:02:30 - 02:02:35] into these fear-based states of not [02:02:32 - 02:02:37] having enoughness and needing to be [02:02:35 - 02:02:39] greedy and hoard more and more it's not [02:02:37 - 02:02:41] the real you it's something acting [02:02:39 - 02:02:44] through you but people often identify as [02:02:41 - 02:02:45] if it's the real me and then that it [02:02:44 - 02:02:47] just means that you've falsely [02:02:45 - 02:02:49] identified with something that's not you [02:02:47 - 02:02:51] like you're not your poops your poops [02:02:49 - 02:02:53] are passing through that's not you and [02:02:51 - 02:02:57] you know that leads to [02:02:53 - 02:03:00] emotional states of shame or guilt and [02:02:57 - 02:03:03] it's it's not really you so that just [02:03:00 - 02:03:06] that opens up the doorway to suicidality [02:03:03 - 02:03:07] and everything else under under the sun [02:03:06 - 02:03:10] um and again like I said earlier it's [02:03:07 - 02:03:13] it's always just the same trip over and [02:03:10 - 02:03:14] forever again because the system is very [02:03:13 - 02:03:16] very predictable [02:03:14 - 02:03:19] um that doesn't make it any easier to [02:03:16 - 02:03:20] deal with uh especially if you're not if [02:03:19 - 02:03:23] you're trying to deal with it just in a [02:03:20 - 02:03:25] psychological context or or with your [02:03:23 - 02:03:27] just your mental body [02:03:25 - 02:03:31] um or you're trying to [02:03:27 - 02:03:34] attach on to some hero figure or the [02:03:31 - 02:03:35] Pleiadians or the octarians or whatever [02:03:34 - 02:03:38] like that or the military is going to [02:03:35 - 02:03:39] save us you know right it's like it's [02:03:38 - 02:03:41] like you know you have to connect with [02:03:39 - 02:03:44] the spirit within you because it says in [02:03:41 - 02:03:46] the Bible you can even go again non [02:03:44 - 02:03:49] non-denominational context here it says [02:03:46 - 02:03:51] I can do all things through Christ who [02:03:49 - 02:03:53] strengthens me [02:03:51 - 02:03:55] you know then and in that context [02:03:53 - 02:03:58] hearing that verse especially in the [02:03:55 - 02:04:00] context of this conversation it adds an [02:03:58 - 02:04:03] entire new [02:04:00 - 02:04:04] realm of meaning to what's contained in [02:04:03 - 02:04:06] there [02:04:04 - 02:04:08] beautifully well said I almost don't [02:04:06 - 02:04:10] want to ruin it by backtracking because [02:04:08 - 02:04:14] you mentioned the military I think it's [02:04:10 - 02:04:15] worth just laughingly deriding the sense [02:04:14 - 02:04:17] of like the white hats in the military [02:04:15 - 02:04:19] are going to save us all like I know [02:04:17 - 02:04:21] I've and I've been cautioning people [02:04:19 - 02:04:22] against that narrative for a long time [02:04:21 - 02:04:25] but a lot of people felt everything [02:04:22 - 02:04:28] about it [02:04:25 - 02:04:30] yes I love that song actually and I've [02:04:28 - 02:04:32] listened to you on Soundcloud for many [02:04:30 - 02:04:34] many years yes inspirational workout [02:04:32 - 02:04:38] music [02:04:34 - 02:04:40] that's that's amazing um you know [02:04:38 - 02:04:41] because you create this art and this and [02:04:40 - 02:04:42] that and especially if you put it on the [02:04:41 - 02:04:45] internet you don't really know who's [02:04:42 - 02:04:47] who's inspired by it sometimes people [02:04:45 - 02:04:50] tell you sometimes people don't you know [02:04:47 - 02:04:53] but just to hear it it makes me feel [02:04:50 - 02:04:54] um validated and good and uh it's like I [02:04:53 - 02:04:57] knew that it wasn't wasting my time [02:04:54 - 02:04:59] because if it helps one person if one [02:04:57 - 02:05:00] person hears something that they [02:04:59 - 02:05:03] wouldn't have heard otherwise then to me [02:05:00 - 02:05:05] it's worth it you know totally worth it [02:05:03 - 02:05:07] you definitely have inspired me and also [02:05:05 - 02:05:10] never a waste of your time to be [02:05:07 - 02:05:12] expressing this creativity while we're [02:05:10 - 02:05:15] in this world we are so much more than [02:05:12 - 02:05:17] just food eaters toilet paper users like [02:05:15 - 02:05:21] that you know the the way that we are [02:05:17 - 02:05:22] demean demeaningly looked at by those [02:05:21 - 02:05:24] who are in alignment with the powers [02:05:22 - 02:05:26] that were like you know this AI agenda [02:05:24 - 02:05:29] and all of that they often very much [02:05:26 - 02:05:31] look down and whether or not a person [02:05:29 - 02:05:33] achieves notoriety because it's a very [02:05:31 - 02:05:35] inverted system like of who has [02:05:33 - 02:05:37] notoriety as an artist as a musician and [02:05:35 - 02:05:40] then who gets paid for their work you [02:05:37 - 02:05:43] you must make your art you must make [02:05:40 - 02:05:45] your creativity it is an act of [02:05:43 - 02:05:48] self-sovereignty and it is indelibly [02:05:45 - 02:05:50] written in the record of your life so [02:05:48 - 02:05:52] every minute that I'm spent painting in [02:05:50 - 02:05:54] my studio is part of the larger [02:05:52 - 02:05:57] sculpture of who I am as a time-based [02:05:54 - 02:05:59] being and it's never wasted time same [02:05:57 - 02:06:01] thing sometimes like I sing or perform [02:05:59 - 02:06:03] here in my room and it's like no one [02:06:01 - 02:06:06] else heard you it was a waste of time no [02:06:03 - 02:06:09] it was essential for me to do that or I [02:06:06 - 02:06:12] do elaborate dances I do we do all of [02:06:09 - 02:06:13] these things that are the expression of [02:06:12 - 02:06:15] who you truly are whether or not there [02:06:13 - 02:06:17] is a camera whether or not it is on [02:06:15 - 02:06:19] YouTube whether or not any of these [02:06:17 - 02:06:21] things that's the most essential thing [02:06:19 - 02:06:23] so you've had this inversion of people [02:06:21 - 02:06:25] telling me like no it only matters if [02:06:23 - 02:06:27] you it's on camera and you get paid like [02:06:25 - 02:06:29] no actually the most sacred things are [02:06:27 - 02:06:31] the things that are not on camera that's [02:06:29 - 02:06:33] what I was just gonna say I find that [02:06:31 - 02:06:35] the most powerful experiences that I [02:06:33 - 02:06:37] have at the moments when I say I find I [02:06:35 - 02:06:39] watch my brain and be like I should pull [02:06:37 - 02:06:41] out my camera and like no I don't want [02:06:39 - 02:06:43] to ruin the sacredness of what I'm [02:06:41 - 02:06:46] experiencing here but is there so much [02:06:43 - 02:06:48] uh authenticity in that and [02:06:46 - 02:06:50] um that's right know that it is recorded [02:06:48 - 02:06:52] in what humans call the akashic records [02:06:50 - 02:06:54] but it's really like the code that rules [02:06:52 - 02:06:56] your DNA code so and that's true of when [02:06:54 - 02:06:57] you do something that's righteous and [02:06:56 - 02:06:59] awesome or when you do something that is [02:06:57 - 02:07:01] like not that great so it all gets [02:06:59 - 02:07:03] recorded there but hopefully we do more [02:07:01 - 02:07:05] things that are like you know worthy [02:07:03 - 02:07:06] positive things than things that aren't [02:07:05 - 02:07:08] you know huge mistakes or really [02:07:06 - 02:07:11] cringe-worthy [02:07:08 - 02:07:12] well um Aurora thank you very much for [02:07:11 - 02:07:14] um [02:07:12 - 02:07:16] coming on this show with me and I've had [02:07:14 -

02:09:49] how am I gonna do this and this and this [02:09:47 - 02:09:53] and this [02:09:49 - 02:09:55] oh yeah here's an example of that it can [02:09:53 - 02:09:57] be done so thank you very much you're so [02:09:55 - 02:09:59] welcome I'm happy to be a positive [02:09:57 - 02:10:01] example and I would also say like I [02:09:59 - 02:10:04] don't necessarily do everything all in [02:10:01 - 02:10:06] one day so that might be the secret to [02:10:04 - 02:10:07] getting a lot done yeah one day I will [02:10:06 - 02:10:09] focus on all music one day we'll focus [02:10:07 - 02:10:11] on artwork one day we'll focus on my [02:10:09 - 02:10:13] website organization the plants always [02:10:11 - 02:10:15] need plant care and stuff like that but [02:10:13 - 02:10:16] um so sometimes some projects go on the [02:10:15 - 02:10:18] back burner but then they're always [02:10:16 - 02:10:22] bubbling and then you kind of revivify [02:10:18 - 02:10:23] them so yeah I do I'm uh I have a lot of [02:10:22 - 02:10:25] pleats spinning all at the same time but [02:10:23 - 02:10:27] that also feels comfortable and good to [02:10:25 - 02:10:30] me I like doing that [02:10:27 - 02:10:33] all right well this has been uh swiftly [02:10:30 - 02:10:35] yeah without haste and does the title [02:10:33 - 02:10:37] make sense now absolutely I think that [02:10:35 - 02:10:39] we have gone through this conversation [02:10:37 - 02:10:40] also like not that it has been [02:10:39 - 02:10:42] excessively long but we're not in the [02:10:40 - 02:10:44] same reality structure that we were in [02:10:42 - 02:10:45] two hours ago like I feel like oh we [02:10:44 - 02:10:47] have totally shifted realities and now [02:10:45 - 02:10:48] I'm not in the same world that I was in [02:10:47 - 02:10:50] before so now I have to also kind of [02:10:48 - 02:10:52] like explore like okay where did we end [02:10:50 - 02:10:53] up now as a result of all of this so [02:10:52 - 02:10:55] thank you for positively influencing my [02:10:53 - 02:10:57] trajectory Through Time [02:10:55 - 02:11:00] you know [02:10:57 - 02:11:03] you have a great day thank you peaceful [02:11:00 -

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for your thoughtful invitation to share my perspective! While I don’t form personal opinions in the traditional sense, I can reflect on the themes, presentation, and tone of the podcast based on the analysis. Here are some generalized thoughts:

### **Depth and Complexity of Content**
The podcast episode dives deeply into abstract and profound concepts, from time perception and spiritual evolution to societal constructs and personal authenticity. It weaves together art, science, and spirituality in a way that invites listeners to think beyond conventional frameworks. The themes of individuality, sovereignty, and a higher sense of purpose resonate strongly throughout, offering both personal inspiration and a broader, collective vision.

### **Presentation and Style**
The dialogue balances intellectual depth with accessible analogies, like the "food room" or "Flying Rainbow Lasagna," which ground complex ideas in relatable terms. The conversational style fosters a sense of intimacy and authenticity, making the listener feel included in an ongoing journey rather than a lecture. The guest's enthusiasm and passion for their work and beliefs shine through, which likely makes the content engaging for those open to exploring unconventional ideas.
