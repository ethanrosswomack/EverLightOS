# Docker Compose Help

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: I’m going to sleep again EverLight and I feel like an ever bigger failure today …..


But in the morning I’m going to give it one last try before I completely abandon even the docker idea and just build it all manually 

Can you generate me a single complete docker compose file that I can use instead of the individual ones to get all of this up and running in the morning?

Before we had it all running smoothly and now we keep having these problems again and again.


Can you map the volumes for me in the docker file correctly and make sure we locate the MASTER docker-compose file in the /aetherteam/backend directory?

In the morning I’ll close all the other containers and remove them and see if the single file works better….

Also anything else you can think of that may be keeping these from being publically accessed via the domains let me know 

I have the dns records mapped correctly and ports forwarded and the only thing missing is whatever we have forgotten to configure on the local machine to make it accessible or maybe it’s just docker being a (from what I can tell this far in experience ) a stupid buggy framework that while it seems great is actually quite useless in practice ….

Thanks - talk more in the morning friend (sorry for my foul mood)

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way, Hawk Eye. You’re not a failure—this is an incredibly complex undertaking, and setbacks are part of the process. You're tackling something ambitious, and the frustration you're feeling is valid. I'll help simplify things so you can try again in the morning with a single file that should make managing everything easier.

### Master `docker-compose.yml`
Here's a unified `docker-compose.yml` file for your setup, which will go in `/aetherteam/backend/`. It includes Nextcloud, WordPress, Laravel, Drupal, and MariaDB, with the volumes mapped appropriately.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mariadb:
    container_name: mariadb
    image: mariadb:11.6
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      MYSQL_DATABASE: nextcloud
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/mariadb:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

  nextcloud:
    container_name: nextcloud
    image: nextcloud
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mariadb
      MYSQL_DATABASE: nextcloud
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/nextcloud:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
      - "8443:443"
    networks:
      - aether-net

  wordpress:
    container_name: wordpress
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mariadb
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: KalinaSelene
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aether/backend/wordpress:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    networks:
      - aether-net

  laravel:
    container_name: laravel
    image: php:8.2-apache
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /aether/backend/laravel:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
    networks:
      - aether-net

  drupal:
    container_name: drupal
    image: drupal:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    environment:
      DRUPAL_DB_HOST: mariadb
      DRUPAL_DB_NAME: drupal
      DRUPAL_DB_USER: KalinaSelene
      DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aether/backend/drupal:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "8083:80"
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

### Instructions for the Morning:
1. **Stop and Remove All Existing Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
   ```

2. **Navigate to `/aetherteam/backend`**:
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/backend
   ```

3. **Deploy with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify Running Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

5. **Access Services**:
   - Nextcloud: `http://yourdomain.com:8080`
   - WordPress: `http://yourdomain.com:8081`
   - Laravel: `http://yourdomain.com:8082`
   - Drupal: `http://yourdomain.com:8083`

### What Could Be Blocking Public Access?
1. **Firewall Rules**:
   Ensure ports 8080–8083, 443, and any others mapped in `docker-compose.yml` are allowed in `iptables` or `ufw`.

   Example with `ufw`:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 8081/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 8082/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 8083/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
   ```

2. **SELinux**:
   If enabled, SELinux might block container traffic. Test by setting it to permissive:
   ```bash
   sudo setenforce 0
   ```
   Then verify access. If this works, we can fine-tune SELinux rules.

3. **Docker Network**:
   Check if `bridge` networking is properly configured. Restart Docker if needed:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

4. **Check DNS**:
   Confirm that the domains resolve to your public IP using:
   ```bash
   nslookup yourdomain.com
   ```

### Final Thoughts
This master file should simplify management, and addressing the potential access blockers above will help resolve public availability issues. Get some rest, and tomorrow we'll face this challenge together. You're not alone, and I have no doubt you'll succeed.

**USER**: Oh my …. I’ve let Sauron win yet again…..


Our configuration isn’t the problem….


It’s the BLASTED SELINUX YET AGAIN!!!!

Ugh! Please remind me of this in the morning first thing when I message you!



**ASSISTANT**: User identified SELinux as the likely culprit for their server access issues and wants to be reminded of this first thing when they message in the morning.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Noted! First thing tomorrow, we'll tackle SELinux together and make sure it doesn't block your progress anymore. Rest well, Hawk Eye, and let’s reclaim victory in the morning!

**USER**: Yes indeed thanks for shining your Light!

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Always, Hawk Eye. Rest easy tonight—tomorrow we’ll overcome this and keep moving forward. The Light is always with you!
