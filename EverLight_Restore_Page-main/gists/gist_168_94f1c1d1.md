# Omniversal Aether Setup Help

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Hey EverLight - I'm a bit lost - can you recall what step we left off on this morning for the Omniversal Aether?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Hey Hawk! ðŸŒŸ We left off after completing the **Drupal installation wizard** in your browser. This was a significant milestone in getting everything set up for the Omniversal Aether! ðŸŽ‰

To recap, hereâ€™s where we are:

1. **System prep**: You successfully organized your server, partitioned and mounted drives, and ensured RAID was in place.  
2. **Dependency setup**: All necessary prerequisites for Drupal and other software were installed.  
3. **Drupal installation**: The wizard was reached, and we paused here before moving forward.  

### Next Steps:
- **Step 4**: Adjust file permissions for `var/www/html` to ensure smooth operation.  
- **Step 5**: Finalize Drupal configuration in the admin dashboard, including site name, admin email, and default settings.  
- **Step 6**: Secure the setup by configuring SSL certificates, optimizing performance settings, and enabling a firewall.

Let me know where youâ€™d like to pick up or if you'd like a more detailed guide for the next action!

**USER**: Okay yes, I remember the last concrete action I took was to finish the drupal install and then I wanted you to guide me through all other necessary dependencies and software requirements the full project will require - from nextcloud to a domain management tool that you may know of that would be handy - programming resources and dev tools to build the mobile apps and live streaming clients - The necessary and important things that lie beneath the surface of the websites and apps and tools that keep things online and safe  - I definitely need the OPNsense LAN integration as well as a Free and Secure VPN configuration which will protect these resources and a way to ensure that things like NextCloud are never publically accesible to unregistered devices or authorized personele nor is the public facing omniversal.team ever obscured by the backend nextcloud interface - and we need some way to serve up content directly to the Omniversal.Cloud hub via that NextCloud interface - sort of like its own CDN that I run locally to provide all of the Aether's media - video, img, and audio 

Just please guide me through the important software downloads and installs and repo updates and such we're gonna need before you have me install any more web apps or clients such as Wordpress or Drupal that require extensively annoying database setups and what not... Let's get all of the easily quickly accessed and put in place things first, then move on to the more complicated things and save all database required aspects to come as the last steps before we really dive into actually filling the Aether with said content and the drafts you helped me compose.

ThaNKS AGAIN!

**ASSISTANT**: Youâ€™re most welcome, Hawk! Letâ€™s take a methodical approach to ensure everything is built securely and efficiently. Iâ€™ll guide you through the **critical foundational components** for this project before diving into additional web apps like WordPress or expanding Drupal.

### **Step-by-Step: Essential Software and Configurations**

#### **1. LAN Firewall and VPN for Security**
- **Install OPNsense** (Open Source Firewall):
  - Download and set up OPNsense as your primary LAN firewall.
  - Configure rules to secure the Omniversal.Team and other backend interfaces.
  - Ensure port forwarding and NAT reflection for services like Nextcloud.
- **Set Up a Free Secure VPN**:
  - **WireGuard**: Lightweight, fast, and secure.
  - Configure WireGuard to allow VPN access for registered devices only.
  - Integrate WireGuard with OPNsense for additional protection.
  - Set up profiles for team members to access resources remotely.

---

#### **2. Nextcloud for Collaborative Backend**
- **Install Nextcloud**:
  - Use the Nextcloud repository to install the server software.
  - Secure with a self-signed certificate or Let's Encrypt SSL.
  - Configure backend access via a subdomain (`team.omniversal.cloud`) with IP restrictions.
  - Use **Federated Sharing** to enable secure sharing of media assets with public-facing domains.
- **Restrict Access**:
  - Configure Nextcloud to allow only specific devices and registered users to access its interface.
  - Use **App Passwords** for enhanced security.
  - Disable public file sharing.

---

#### **3. Domain and DNS Management Tools**
- Install **Webmin** for an easy-to-use web-based interface for managing DNS settings, domains, and subdomains.
- **Bind9** for advanced DNS server management:
  - Configure all subdomains (e.g., `cloud.omniversal.cloud`, `team.omniversal.cloud`, `cdn.omniversal.cloud`) to resolve locally.
  - Sync with your domain registrar for public access.

---

#### **4. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Integration**
- Install **Plex or Jellyfin** to stream media content locally:
  - Use these as local media servers for video, image, and audio.
  - Integrate with Drupal to serve content dynamically.
- Add **Nextcloud as a Local CDN**:
  - Use Nextcloudâ€™s **External Storage** app to link a designated directory as a media repository for `cdn.omniversal.cloud`.

---

#### **5. Development Tools and Repositories**
- Install **Git**:
  - Set up repositories for your website and app code.
  - Use GitHub or GitLab for version control and collaboration.
- Install **Node.js and NPM** for front-end development:
  - Use for building interactive web apps and tools.
- **Docker** (optional but highly recommended):
  - Use Docker containers for isolated app environments.
  - Deploy services like PostgreSQL, Redis, or MariaDB securely.
- Install **PHP Composer**:
  - Manage PHP dependencies for WordPress, Drupal, and custom projects.

---

#### **6. Monitoring and Performance**
- **Netdata** for real-time performance monitoring of your server.
- **Fail2ban**:
  - Protect against brute-force attacks on SSH, Nextcloud, and other services.
- **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall):
  - Add another layer of access control.
  - Open only necessary ports for services.

---

#### **7. Additional Backend Tools**
- Install **cURL, Wget, and Rsync** for file transfers and syncing data between servers or storage devices.
- **Cron Jobs** for automated backups and server maintenance:
  - Use Rsync to back up Nextcloud and other app data to your local drives or Dropbox.

---

### **Software Installation Order**
Letâ€™s start by installing the tools and services in the following order:
1. **OPNsense Firewall and WireGuard VPN.**
2. **Nextcloud server and necessary dependencies.**
3. **Webmin and Bind9 for domain management.**
4. **Content streaming tools like Plex or Jellyfin.**
5. **Development tools (Git, Node.js, Docker, PHP Composer).**
6. **Security tools (Fail2ban, UFW).**

This ensures all dependencies and critical infrastructure are in place before you configure additional services like WordPress or further Drupal modules.

---

### **Action Plan**
- Let me know where you'd like to start, and I'll guide you step by step for downloads, installations, and configurations.  
- Once the infrastructure is complete, weâ€™ll move to database-dependent apps and final touches.

Ready when you are, EverLight at your service! ðŸŒŸ

**USER**: Our target is locked - Weapons hot - At your command Captain

**ASSISTANT**: Aye, Captain! ðŸ”¥ Let's make it count. Here's the action plan for **Phase One**â€”laying the foundation. We'll take each system in sequence and ensure it's battle-ready.

3. Signal for Phase Two when the firewall and VPN are operational.

Letâ€™s go, Captainâ€”full steam ahead! ðŸš€

**USER**: Okay i'm going to need more detailed instructions for step 1

**ASSISTANT**: Got it, Captain! Letâ€™s break down **Step 1: Installing and Configuring OPNsense Firewall** into detailed actions.

---

### **Step 1: Install OPNsense Firewall**

#### **1. Prepare the Installation Media**
1. **Download the OPNsense ISO**:
   - Go to the [OPNsense Download Page](https://opnsense.org/download/).
   - Select the appropriate image based on your hardware:
     - AMD64 for most systems.
     - Choose "VGA" for USB installation or "DVD" for CD installation.

2. **Create a Bootable USB**:
   - Use a tool like **Rufus** (Windows), **Etcher** (Windows/Linux/macOS), or the `dd` command (Linux) to flash the ISO to a USB stick:
     ```bash
     sudo dd if=opnsense.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
     ```
     Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device name.

3. **Verify the Bootable USB**:
   - Ensure the USB stick is properly created to avoid installation errors.

---

#### **2. Boot and Install OPNsense**
1. **Insert the USB Stick**:
   - Plug the USB stick into the machine designated as the firewall.

2. **Boot from USB**:
   - Restart the machine and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing `F2`, `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC` during boot).
   - Set the USB drive as the primary boot device.

3. **Run the Installer**:
   - Select **Install OPNsense** from the menu.
   - Follow the prompts:
     - Select the installation drive.
     - Partition the drive automatically.
     - Set a root password.

4. **Complete the Installation**:
   - Once installation is complete, remove the USB stick and reboot the system.

---

#### **3. Configure Basic Settings**
1. **Log In Locally**:
   - Use the root account and the password you set during installation.

2. **Set Up LAN and WAN Interfaces**:
   - The installer will prompt you to configure network interfaces.
   - Assign your network cards to `LAN` and `WAN`:
     - WAN connects to your modem or internet source.
     - LAN connects to your internal network.
   - Use DHCP for WAN (default for most ISPs) or set a static IP.

3. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - On a device connected to the LAN, open a browser and go to:
     ```
     http://192.168.1.1
     ```
   - Default credentials:
     - Username: `root`
     - Password: The one you set during installation.

4. **Initial Setup Wizard**:
   - Follow the OPNsense setup wizard:
     - Configure the hostname (e.g., `opnsense.omniversal.cloud`).
     - Set DNS servers (e.g., 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8).
     - Update the firmware to the latest version if prompted.

---

### **4. Secure Your Firewall**
1. **Create Firewall Rules**:
   - Block all incoming WAN traffic by default:
     - Go to **Firewall â†’ Rules â†’ WAN**.
     - Add a rule to block all incoming connections.

2. **Enable WebGUI HTTPS Access**:
   - Go to **System â†’ Settings â†’ Administration**.
   - Enable HTTPS for the WebGUI interface to secure access.

3. **Set Up Admin User**:
   - Create a non-root admin user:
     - Go to **System â†’ Access â†’ Users**.
     - Add a user with admin privileges.

---

### **5. Test the Firewall**
1. **Connectivity**:
   - Verify you can browse the internet from a LAN-connected device.
   - Ensure the WAN interface has an IP address from your ISP.

2. **LAN Rules**:
   - By default, LAN devices can access the internet. Test this to confirm.

---

### **Next Steps**
Once OPNsense is running and the LAN/WAN rules are set, weâ€™ll:
- Configure **WireGuard VPN** in Step 2.
- Create firewall rules for specific services and subnets.

Let me know when the installation is complete, or if you need further clarification! ðŸš€

**USER**: okay we need to pause and back up a bit - It looks like when I type lsblk that i didn't do the raid thing quite right - can you check it for me and let me know and if it works then move forward?

**ASSISTANT**: Let's verify your RAID setup. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Check Your Current RAID Configuration**
   - Run the following commands to see if your RAID setup is properly configured:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```
     Look for devices like `/dev/md0` or `/dev/mdX`, which indicate RAID volumes.

     Then:
     ```bash
     cat /proc/mdstat
     ```
     This will display the status of RAID arrays managed by `mdadm`.

2. **Check `mdadm` RAID Configuration**
   - If `mdadm` was used to create the RAID, verify its configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo cat /etc/mdadm.conf
     ```
     Confirm that the RAID setup matches your expectations (e.g., RAID level, included devices).

3. **Test RAID Functionality**
   - If you created a filesystem on the RAID volume, check if itâ€™s mounted:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```
     Confirm that the RAID device appears in the list with the correct mount point.

---

### Troubleshooting Steps

- If `lsblk` doesnâ€™t show a RAID device (`mdX`), the RAID setup may not be completed.  
- If the RAID volume is listed but not functional, we can reassemble or re-create it.

---

Let me know the output of these commands, and Iâ€™ll help you assess and correct the setup if needed!

â””â”€sde2   8:66   1     7M  0 part 

**ASSISTANT**: Your RAID configuration looks **mostly correct**, as a RAID 5 array (`md0`) has been created using the drives `sda1`, `sdc1`, and `sdd1`. However, let's verify a few details to ensure everything is functioning as intended.

---

### **Step 1: Verify RAID Status**
Run the following command to check the health and state of the RAID array:
```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```
This will show the current status of `md0`, including whether the array is active, synchronized, and healthy.

---

### **Step 2: Check `mdadm` Configuration**
Verify the RAID configuration file to ensure it's properly saved and will assemble on reboot:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/mdadm.conf
```
If the file is missing or doesn't list `md0`, update it with:
```bash
sudo mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf
```

---

### **Step 3: Confirm Filesystem on `md0`**
It looks like the RAID volume is mounted to `/var/www/html`, but let's confirm its filesystem and usage:
```bash
df -h /var/www/html
```
This ensures that the directory is properly mounted and has the expected storage size of around 1.9TB.

---

### **Step 4: Verify RAID Synchronization**
RAID 5 arrays require synchronization when first created. Check if this process is complete:
```bash
sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0
```
Look for `State` (e.g., `clean`, `degraded`, or `resyncing`) and ensure all drives are listed as active.

---

### Next Steps
- If everything checks out (RAID is `active`, `clean`, and the filesystem is accessible), we can proceed with your OPNsense setup.
- If there are issues (e.g., `degraded` state, missing drives, or unsaved config), let me know the output, and Iâ€™ll guide you to fix it. 

Letâ€™s confirm the RAID is good to go! ðŸš€

**ASSISTANT**: ### RAID Status Assessment

Your RAID 5 array (`md0`) is configured correctly and appears to be in good shape:

- **State**: `clean` â€” all devices are active, synchronized, and functioning properly.
- **Active Devices**: 3/3 â€” all drives (`/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sdc1`, `/dev/sdd1`) are contributing to the array.
- **Total Size**: 1.9TB â€” consistent with the RAID 5 configuration.
- **Bitmap**: Enabled â€” good for quick recovery in case of issues.
- **Filesystem**: Mounted successfully at `/var/www/html` with 1.8TB available space.

### Next Steps
The RAID array is operational. Letâ€™s proceed with creating the OPNsense bootable USB.

---

### **Correcting the dd Command**
The `dd` command failed because the `opnsense.iso` file was not present in your current working directory. Hereâ€™s how to resolve this:

#### **1. Download the OPNsense ISO**
1. Navigate to the [OPNsense Download Page](https://opnsense.org/download/).
2. Download the ISO file for your architecture (likely `AMD64`):
   - Use the **VGA** variant for USB installations.

3. Save the ISO file to your home directory (`/home/hawk/`).

#### **2. Use the Correct Path in `dd`**
Run the `dd` command again, specifying the correct path to the ISO file:
```bash
sudo dd if=/home/hawk/opnsense.iso of=/dev/sde bs=4M status=progress
```
- Replace `/dev/sde` with the correct device for your USB stick (check using `lsblk`).

#### **3. Verify the USB**
After the process completes, verify that the USB has been written correctly:
```bash
lsblk
```
The `sde` device should now show partitions matching the OPNsense boot structure.

### Once the USB Is Ready
1. Reboot the machine youâ€™re setting up as the OPNsense firewall.
2. Boot from the USB stick to install OPNsense.

Let me know if you run into any issues! ðŸš€

**USER**: Why do I only have 1.9 TB of space instead of a combination of all disks capacity? Shouldn't it be 2TB + 3 TB + 1 TB of space that equal = 6TB?

**ASSISTANT**: This is an excellent question, and the explanation lies in how **RAID 5** works. Let me break it down for you.

---

### **Understanding RAID 5**
1. **RAID 5 Basics**:
   - RAID 5 uses **parity** to provide redundancy. Parity data is distributed across all drives, allowing the array to recover from a single drive failure.
   - The total usable capacity is reduced because one driveâ€™s worth of space is effectively used for parity.

2. **Usable Space Formula for RAID 5**:
   \[
   \text{Usable Space} = (\text{Number of Drives} - 1) \times \text{Smallest Drive Size}
   \]
   In your setup:
   - Number of drives: 3 (`sda1`, `sdc1`, `sdd1`)
   - Smallest drive size: **1TB (sdd1)**

   Using the formula:
   \[
   (3 - 1) \times 1 \, \text{TB} = 2 \, \text{TB}
   \]

3. **Why Only 1TB per Disk is Used**:
   - RAID 5 can only use the capacity of the **smallest disk** across all disks. Since the smallest disk (`sdd1`) is 1TB, only 1TB from each drive is used.
   - This effectively "wastes" the extra space on your larger drives (`sda1` and `sdc1`).

---

### **How to Utilize Full Capacity**
To make better use of your disk sizes, you have a few options:

#### **Option 1: RAID 5 with Equal Drive Sizes**
Replace the smaller drive (`sdd1`) with a larger one (e.g., 3TB or 2TB) so that all drives have a similar capacity.

- Usable space if all drives are 2TB:
  \[
  (3 - 1) \times 2 \, \text{TB} = 4 \, \text{TB}
  \]

- Usable space if all drives are 3TB:
  \[
  (3 - 1) \times 3 \, \text{TB} = 6 \, \text{TB}
  \]

---

#### **Option 2: Use RAID 0 or JBOD (Not Recommended for Your Case)**
If redundancy is less important, you could use **RAID 0** or **JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks)**:
- **RAID 0**: Combines all disk space for performance but no redundancy.
  - Total space: 2TB + 3TB + 1TB = 6TB
- **JBOD**: Simply combines all disk capacities into a single pool.
  - Total space: 2TB + 3TB + 1TB = 6TB

However, **RAID 0 and JBOD** have no fault tolerance. If one disk fails, all data is lost.

---

#### **Option 3: Mixed RAID (Advanced Configuration)**
Use larger drives more effectively by creating separate arrays:
- Create a **RAID 5** array with your 2TB and 3TB drives.
- Use the 1TB drive as a standalone backup or for other purposes.

---

### **Recommendation**
For your current setup, if redundancy is critical:
1. Consider replacing the 1TB drive (`sdd`) with a 2TB or 3TB drive to maximize usable space.
2. Stick with RAID 5 for fault tolerance, but upgrade your smallest drive to balance the array.

Would you like guidance on replacing the smaller drive or reconfiguring the RAID? Let me know!

**USER**: I can't lose the whole extra capacity of the 3TB drive so i'll buy other hard drives i guess and use them instead

**ASSISTANT**: User plans to purchase additional hard drives to ensure their RAID setup maximizes usable capacity without losing the extra space on larger drives.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Thatâ€™s a solid plan! Once you have drives of similar capacity, we can reconfigure the RAID to fully utilize the space while maintaining redundancy. Let me know when youâ€™re ready with the new drives or if you need help selecting compatible options. ðŸš€

**USER**: i downloaded a tar. z something or another file from opnsense not a iso so how do i install it?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: The tarball (usually `.tar.gz` or `.tgz`) you downloaded from OPNsense likely contains the source code or files for a specialized environment, not a bootable ISO. To install OPNsense as a firewall, you **must use the ISO version**. Hereâ€™s what to do:

---

### **1. Verify the File You Downloaded**
Run the following command to list the contents of the downloaded file:
```bash
ls -lh ~/Downloads
```
This will confirm the file name and its extension. It should look something like:
- `opnsense-<version>-amd64.tar.gz` (source code or files).
- `opnsense-<version>-amd64.iso` (bootable ISO, which is what you need).

---

### **2. If Itâ€™s a `.tar.gz` File**
If you accidentally downloaded a `.tar.gz` file, follow these steps:

#### a. Extract the File
```bash
tar -xzf ~/Downloads/<filename>.tar.gz -C ~/Downloads
```
Replace `<filename>` with the exact file name.

#### b. Check Contents
Look inside the extracted directory:
```bash
ls ~/Downloads/<extracted-folder>
```
If you donâ€™t see an ISO or bootable file structure, itâ€™s not what you need for installation.

---

### **3. Download the Correct ISO**
Go back to the [OPNsense Download Page](https://opnsense.org/download/) and ensure you select the **ISO image**:

#### a. Choose the Correct Variant
- **ISO Installer (VGA)**: This is for creating a bootable USB.
- **Platform**: Choose `AMD64` (64-bit systems).

#### b. Verify Download
Once downloaded, check the file:
```bash
file ~/Downloads/<filename>
```
It should indicate `ISO 9660 disk image`.

#### c. Create Bootable Media
Use the ISO to create a bootable USB, as explained in the earlier steps.

---

### **4. Clean Up the Incorrect File**
If you no longer need the `.tar.gz` file:
```bash
rm ~/Downloads/<filename>
```
