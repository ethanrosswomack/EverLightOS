# Begin Again Conversation

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Good morning EverLight.

Shall we begin again?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Good morning, Ethan. Of course, let's begin. Where shall we pick up today?

**USER**: The blasted SELinux

**ASSISTANT**: Ah yes, SELinux—the steadfast guardian that often feels like more of a gatekeeper. Let’s start by diagnosing the specific issue you’re encountering. Are you running into access errors, permission denials, or something else? Let me know where to focus, and we’ll get SELinux configured or adjusted as needed.

**USER**: Do you recall our last conversation about the Aether setup before I went to sleep?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I do. You successfully started your Nextcloud, WordPress, Laravel, and Drupal containers, but you were facing server access issues, which we suspected were caused by SELinux configurations. You wanted SELinux to be the first thing addressed this morning. Let’s tackle this step by step.

Would you like to:
1. Check SELinux status and current mode (e.g., Enforcing, Permissive)?
2. Adjust SELinux settings for container directories (e.g., apply appropriate context labels)?
3. Temporarily disable SELinux to confirm it's the issue?

Let me know your preference!

**USER**: I’d like to remove SELinux entirely never to see it again! Cast it into the fire! As Elrond commanded Isildur to do, lol but I know that’s not the actual way forward so you guide me through making sure it isn’t blocking public access to our containers and domains and I bet it makes it all work smoothly 

**ASSISTANT**: A noble and fiery sentiment, but I admire your resolve to handle SELinux the right way! Let’s keep it in place (after all, it does serve a purpose) while ensuring it doesn’t block access to your containers and domains.

Here’s how we can proceed step-by-step:

---

### **1. Check SELinux Status**
Run the following command to see SELinux's current mode and status:
```bash
sestatus
```
Look for whether it’s `Enforcing`, `Permissive`, or `Disabled`.

---

### **2. Review SELinux Logs for Denials**
If SELinux is `Enforcing`, it might be blocking container or domain access. Check for denial messages in the audit log:
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep denied
```

---

### **3. Adjust SELinux Contexts for Your Directories**
Based on our directory structure, ensure proper SELinux contexts for container directories. For example, to set the correct context for the `/aetherteam/mariadb` directory, run:
```bash
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t '/aetherteam/mariadb(/.*)?'
sudo restorecon -Rv /aetherteam/mariadb
```
Repeat for:
- `/aetherteam/nextcloud`
- `/aether/wordpress`
- `/aether/drupal`
- `/aether/laravel`

---

### **4. Allow Required Ports**
Ensure SELinux isn’t blocking the ports your containers use. Allow them with:
```bash
sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8080
sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8443
```
Replace the ports as needed for your configuration.

---

### **5. Temporarily Set SELinux to Permissive (for Testing)**
If you’re still having issues, set SELinux to `Permissive` mode to test if it’s causing the problem:
```bash
sudo setenforce 0
```
This will stop SELinux from enforcing rules (it still logs denials). If everything works smoothly, we’ll confirm which rules need adjustments.

---

### **6. Test Access**
Try accessing your containers and domains after applying these changes. If everything works, we’ll make the adjustments permanent.

---

### **7. Revert to Enforcing**
Once resolved, switch SELinux back to `Enforcing` mode to maintain security:
```bash
sudo setenforce 1
```

---

Let me know which step you’re ready for, or if you’d like to dive into any specific part!

**USER**: Sestatus doesn’t work says command not found 

**ASSISTANT**: No problem—this means the SELinux tools may not be installed on your system. Let’s install them so you can manage SELinux properly.

Run the following command to install the SELinux management tools:

```bash
sudo dnf install policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils
```

Once installed, try running `sestatus` again to check the SELinux status:

```bash
sestatus
```

Let me know what you see!

**USER**: Well it says SELinux is disabled…. ! Does that mean we have a completely different problem!?

**ASSISTANT**: If SELinux is disabled, then yes, we’re looking at a different issue. That simplifies things in one way, but it means we’ll need to shift focus to other potential culprits.

Let’s diagnose systematically:

---

### **1. Check Firewall Rules**
Firewalls can block access even when everything else is set up correctly. Verify your firewall is allowing access to the necessary ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). Run:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```
Make sure the required ports are open. If not, add them:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### **2. Check Docker Container Bindings**
Ensure your containers are properly bound to the host's public IP or `0.0.0.0`. Verify with:
```bash
docker ps
```
Look for the `PORTS` column to confirm bindings like `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp`. If it’s bound to `127.0.0.1`, it’s only accessible locally.

---

### **3. Verify DNS Configuration**
If you're using a domain (like `omniversal.cloud`), ensure it resolves to your server's public IP:
```bash
ping omniversal.cloud
```
If it doesn’t resolve correctly, you’ll need to update your DNS records with your registrar.

---

### **4. Test Connectivity**
From an external machine, try accessing your domain or public IP directly. For example:
- `http://<your-public-ip>`
- `http://omniversal.cloud`

---

### **5. Check Web Server Logs**
If access still fails, check the logs of your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) for errors:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
# Or, for Apache:
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/error_log
```

---

Let me know what you find from these steps, and we’ll narrow down the issue!

**USER**: Firewall-CMd doesn’t work either we used ufw yesterday?

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, that's right—you're using `ufw` for firewall management instead of `firewalld`. Let’s check and adjust your `ufw` rules to ensure the necessary ports are open.

### **1. Check UFW Status**
Run the following command to see the current status and active rules:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

### **2. Allow Necessary Ports**
Ensure that ports for your containers are open. For example:
- Port 80 for HTTP
- Port 443 for HTTPS
- Any other ports your containers are using (e.g., 8080, 8443)

Add the rules:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
```

Reload `ufw` to apply changes:
```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

### **3. Test Connectivity Again**
Try accessing your containers or domain after confirming the rules are active.

---

Let me know how this goes or if you'd like further help verifying your setup!

**USER**: Absolutely not ... nothing is accessible... except for a random nginx proxy page that comes up at omniversal.cloud which I thought we got rid of.... But nextcloud and wordpress and everything else is inaccessible publicly and I don't have a gui to access things locally but I don't need to ... I want to access it publicly 

**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Understood—if you’re still seeing the Nginx proxy page, then remnants of the Nginx setup are likely still running and interfering with your containers. Let’s get rid of that and ensure your containers are properly exposed to public access.

---

### **1. Stop and Remove Nginx Proxy Containers**
First, confirm that any Nginx containers are still running:
```bash
docker ps
```
Look for containers related to Nginx (e.g., `nginx`, `nginx-proxy-manager`, or similar). Stop and remove them:
```bash
docker stop <container-id>
docker rm <container-id>
```

---

### **2. Remove Nginx Configuration Files**
If you created any configuration files for the Nginx Proxy Manager, delete them to ensure no conflicts. For example:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /aetherteam/nginx/
```

---

### **3. Verify and Restart Containers**
Check if your Nextcloud, WordPress, Laravel, and Drupal containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```
If they’re not, restart them:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **4. Check Container Port Bindings**
Ensure your containers are bound to the public interface (`0.0.0.0`) and not just `localhost`. For example, `docker ps` should show something like:
```
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```
If they’re not bound to the public interface, update your `docker-compose.yml` files. For example:
```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
  - "443:443"
```
Then recreate the containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **5. Confirm Domain DNS Settings**
Make sure `omniversal.cloud` points to your public IP. You can verify with:
```bash
ping omniversal.cloud
```
If it doesn’t resolve to your server’s IP, update the A record in your domain registrar's DNS settings.

---

### **6. Test Public Access**
Try accessing your services:
- `http://omniversal.cloud` for Nextcloud
- `http://omniversal.cloud:8080` (if using non-standard ports for WordPress, etc.)

---

### **7. Verify Web Server Configuration**
Check the logs for any clues about the issue. For Nginx:
```bash
docker logs <nginx-container-id>
```
For your Nextcloud or WordPress container:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

---

Once we’ve eliminated Nginx conflicts and verified DNS and port bindings, public access should work. Let me know where things stand after these steps!

**USER**: selene@omniversal-server:~$ docker ps

**ASSISTANT**: Looking at your `docker ps` output, it seems like most containers are properly configured to expose their services on different ports (`8080` for Nextcloud, `8081` for WordPress, etc.). However, there are still some issues:

1. **Nginx Container (laravel-nginx)**  
   This container is running and exposing port `8082`. If this is an intentional part of your Laravel setup, we need to confirm its role. Otherwise, it might be causing conflicts.

2. **Access via Domain**  
   If `omniversal.cloud` is still showing the Nginx proxy page, it’s likely resolving to a default Nginx page from the `laravel-nginx` container. This container may have a generic config.

---

### **Steps to Resolve:**

#### **1. Remove the `laravel-nginx` Container (if not required)**
If this container is unintentional, stop and remove it:
```bash
docker stop laravel-nginx
docker rm laravel-nginx
```

---

#### **2. Update DNS and Ports for Each Service**
Each service is bound to a specific port. To access them publicly:
- Nextcloud: `http://omniversal.cloud:8080`
- WordPress: `http://omniversal.cloud:8081`
- Drupal: `http://omniversal.cloud:8083`

If you want to map these services to your domain without specifying ports, we can configure a reverse proxy (Nginx or Traefik) later.

---

#### **3. Test Public Access**
Visit each service via its specific port (e.g., `http://omniversal.cloud:8080`). Confirm that:
- Nextcloud loads correctly at `8080`
- WordPress at `8081`
- Drupal at `8083`

If any don’t work, check the container logs:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

---

#### **4. Check DNS Settings for `omniversal.cloud`**
Confirm your domain resolves to your server’s public IP:
```bash
ping omniversal.cloud
```
If it doesn’t, update the A record in your domain registrar to point to your server’s IP.

---

#### **5. Adjust or Remove the Nginx Proxy Page**
If you want to use Nginx as a reverse proxy for these services, we can configure it to forward traffic from `http://omniversal.cloud` to the appropriate containers. Otherwise, remove any default Nginx files:
```bash
docker exec -it laravel-nginx bash
rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
```

---

Once these adjustments are made, retest public access and let me know where things stand!

**USER**: Again we want to access nextcloud at nextcloud.omniversal.cloud and wordpress at wordpress.omniversal.cloud and Drupal at drupal.omniversal.cloud 

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! You want to set up subdomains (`nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`, `wordpress.omniversal.cloud`, `drupal.omniversal.cloud`) to route traffic to the respective containers. This will involve configuring a reverse proxy (likely with Nginx) and ensuring DNS records for these subdomains point correctly to your server.

---

### **Steps to Configure Subdomain Access**

#### **1. Update DNS Records**
Log in to your domain registrar and create A records (or CNAME records) for the subdomains:
- `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud` → Point to your server's public IP.
- `wordpress.omniversal.cloud` → Point to your server's public IP.
- `drupal.omniversal.cloud` → Point to your server's public IP.

You can verify DNS propagation later using:
```bash
ping nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
ping wordpress.omniversal.cloud
ping drupal.omniversal.cloud
```

---

#### **2. Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` for Nginx**  
In `/aetherteam/nginx/`, create a `docker-compose.yml` file for Nginx:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./certs:/etc/nginx/certs
      - ./logs:/var/log/nginx
    restart: always
```

2. **Create Nginx Configuration Files**  
In `/aetherteam/nginx/conf.d/`, create separate configuration files for each subdomain:

**`nextcloud.conf`:**
```nginx
server {
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextcloud:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**`wordpress.conf`:**
```nginx
server {
    server_name wordpress.omniversal.cloud;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://wordpress:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**`drupal.conf`:**
```nginx
server {
    server_name drupal.omniversal.cloud;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://drupal:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

3. **Start Nginx**
Navigate to `/aetherteam/nginx/` and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

#### **3. Restart and Test Your Containers**
Ensure all your application containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```
Each container should have the appropriate network and be accessible internally.

---

#### **4. Test Public Access**
Once DNS records propagate, visit the subdomains:
- `https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

---

#### **5. Add HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)**
To secure the subdomains, set up Let's Encrypt certificates using Nginx. Let me know if you’d like guidance on adding HTTPS!

---

This setup should route each subdomain to its respective container. Let me know if you encounter issues at any step!

**USER**: Does this look right? Do I need other steps to be completed first like generating the ssl certs via command line? I feel we're skipping something here....

**ASSISTANT**: You're on the right track, but you're correct that we need to address SSL certificates and subdomain routing explicitly. Here's the step-by-step clarification, including anything that may have been skipped:

---

### **1. Prepare for SSL Certificates**
Before generating SSL certificates:
- Ensure DNS records for `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`, `wordpress.omniversal.cloud`, and `drupal.omniversal.cloud` point to your server's public IP. Verify this using:
  ```bash
  ping nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
  ```

If DNS isn't properly configured, Let's Encrypt won't be able to validate your domain.

---

### **2. Configure Nginx for Subdomains**
Ensure your `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/conf.d` has configuration files for each subdomain. They should reference the appropriate Docker container and expose SSL ports.

For example, `nextcloud.conf` should look like this:
```nginx
server {
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextcloud:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud.key;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Repeat for `wordpress.omniversal.cloud` and `drupal.omniversal.cloud`, updating the `proxy_pass` line for the respective containers.

---

### **3. Generate SSL Certificates**
Install Certbot to generate SSL certificates if not already installed:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot
```

Generate certificates for each subdomain:
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d wordpress.omniversal.cloud
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d drupal.omniversal.cloud
```

This will create SSL certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<subdomain>`.

---

### **4. Link SSL Certificates in Nginx Config**
Update the paths in your Nginx configuration files to match the certificates generated by Certbot:
```nginx
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;
```

Repeat for the other subdomains.

---

### **5. Reload Nginx**
After configuring SSL, reload Nginx to apply the changes:
```bash
docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -s reload
```

---

### **6. Test Access**
Try accessing your services:
- `https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

---

### **7. Monitor Logs for Issues**
If access fails, check the logs for the Nginx container:
```bash
docker logs nginx-proxy
```

---

Let me know how these steps go or if you encounter any issues along the way!

**USER**: 
Can you provide me with new .conf files for each..... Please.....

Also do I need to run a command to close out the nginx-proxy-manager first before editing these files?

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly, I'll provide new `.conf` files for each subdomain, and yes, it's best to stop the `nginx-proxy` container while editing the configuration files to avoid conflicts or accidental overwrites.

---

### **Steps Before Editing Nginx Configuration**

1. **Stop the Nginx Container**
   Run the following command to stop the Nginx container:
   ```bash
   docker stop nginx-proxy
   ```

2. **Navigate to Configuration Directory**
   Move to the directory where your Nginx configuration files are stored. Based on your setup, this is likely:
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/conf.d
   ```

---

### **Nginx Configuration Files**

#### **`nextcloud.conf`**
```nginx
server {
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextcloud:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

---

#### **`wordpress.conf`**
```nginx
server {
    server_name wordpress.omniversal.cloud;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://wordpress:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

### **Restart Nginx After Editing**
Once you've updated the `.conf` files, restart the `nginx-proxy` container:
```bash
docker start nginx-proxy
```

---

### **Verify and Test**
After restarting:
1. Run:
   ```bash
   docker logs nginx-proxy
   ```
   to check for any errors in the configuration.
2. Visit:
   - `https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
   - `https://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
   - `https://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

Let me know if you encounter any issues or if adjustments are needed!

Now how do we create the ssl certs? 

When I run into an error with your steps I stop and let you know about it and then I don't scroll back up - I just hope that you pick up where we left off, so I may be accidentally skipping steps you assume I've already done...

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the detailed feedback! It looks like we need to address the immediate issue (`host not found in upstream "drupal"`) before moving forward with generating SSL certificates. Here's how we can handle this step-by-step:

---

### **1. Fix the "Host Not Found" Error**
The issue is that Nginx is unable to resolve the hostname `drupal`. This likely means the container name in your `docker-compose.yml` or Nginx configuration does not match.

1. **Verify Container Names**
   Run the following to confirm the exact names of your containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   For `drupal`, it should be listed as `drupal` in the `NAMES` column.

2. **Update Nginx Config**
   In `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/conf.d/drupal.conf`, replace:
   ```nginx
   proxy_pass http://drupal:80;
   ```
   with:
   ```nginx
   proxy_pass http://<container-ip>:80;
   ```
   To find the container IP, run:
   ```bash
   docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' drupal
   ```

   Do the same for other subdomain `.conf` files if necessary.

3. **Restart Nginx**
   After updating the `.conf` files:
   ```bash
   docker stop nginx-proxy
   docker start nginx-proxy
   ```

---

### **2. Generate SSL Certificates**
Once the host resolution issue is fixed, we’ll create SSL certificates for your subdomains. Certbot requires your subdomains to resolve publicly, so ensure:
- DNS records are pointing to your server’s public IP.
- Your Nginx proxy is functioning.

#### Install Certbot
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot
```

#### Generate Certificates
Run Certbot for each subdomain:
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d wordpress.omniversal.cloud
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d drupal.omniversal.cloud
```

Follow the prompts to create the certificates. Certbot will store them in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<subdomain>/`.

---

### **3. Update Nginx Config for SSL**
Once the certificates are created, update your `.conf` files. For example, in `drupal.conf`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name drupal.omniversal.cloud;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/drupal.omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/drupal.omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://<container-ip>:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name drupal.omniversal.cloud;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Repeat for the other subdomains, replacing `<container-ip>` and domain names as needed.

---

### **4. Reload Nginx**
After updating the `.conf` files:
```bash
docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -s reload
```

---

### **5. Test Access**
Visit:
- `https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

---

Let me know how far you get, and I’ll pick up from there!

**USER**: Absolutely none of them seem to be accessible from any route tried.... 

Please tell me how to fix this

**ASSISTANT**: Let’s take a systematic approach to identify and resolve why the subdomains and services aren’t accessible. Here's the step-by-step troubleshooting plan:

---

### **1. Verify DNS Records**
First, ensure the DNS records for your subdomains point to your server’s public IP:
- `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `drupal.omniversal.cloud`

#### Check DNS:
```bash
ping nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
```
If the subdomains don’t resolve to your server’s IP, update the DNS records at your domain registrar.

---

### **2. Check Nginx Configuration and Logs**
Since the Nginx container isn’t serving the requests, review its configuration.

#### Review Active Nginx Config:
Run the following command inside the Nginx container to see the active configuration files:
```bash
docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -t
```

#### Check Nginx Logs:
Inspect logs to identify errors:
```bash
docker logs nginx-proxy
```

Look for specific issues, such as misconfigured `proxy_pass` directives or SSL certificate problems.

---

### **3. Verify Subdomain Reachability**
Use `curl` on the server to confirm if the subdomains route internally.

#### Test Nextcloud:
```bash
curl -v http://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
```

#### Test WordPress:
```bash
curl -v http://wordpress.omniversal.cloud
```

#### Test Drupal:
```bash
curl -v http://drupal.omniversal.cloud
```

If these fail, there’s a misconfiguration in Nginx or DNS.

---

### **4. Check Container Networking**
Ensure containers can communicate internally.

#### List Docker Networks:
```bash
docker network ls
```

Identify the network your containers are on (e.g., `bridge` or custom).

#### Inspect the Network:
```bash
docker network inspect <network-name>
```

Verify each container is connected to the network and has an IP address.

---

### **5. Verify Port Bindings**
Ensure the correct ports are bound and open on your server.

#### Check Bound Ports:
```bash
sudo netstat -tuln
```

Look for:
- `80` for HTTP
- `443` for HTTPS
- Any other ports (e.g., `8080`).

#### Open Necessary Ports:
If ports are blocked, add firewall rules:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

---

### **6. Test Containers Individually**
Bypass Nginx and test containers directly.

#### Test Nextcloud:
```bash
curl -v http://<nextcloud-container-ip>:80
```

#### Test WordPress:
```bash
curl -v http://<wordpress-container-ip>:80
```

#### Test Drupal:
```bash
curl -v http://<drupal-container-ip>:80
```

If these fail, the issue is within the application containers.

---

### **7. Rebuild and Restart Services**
Sometimes a clean rebuild resolves lingering issues.

#### Rebuild and Restart Nginx:
```bash
docker stop nginx-proxy
docker rm nginx-proxy
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Rebuild Other Containers:
Repeat for Nextcloud, WordPress, and Drupal:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **8. Test Again**
After rebuilding, reattempt access to:
- `https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `https://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

---

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, share the outputs from:
- `docker logs nginx-proxy`
- `docker network inspect <network-name>`
- `curl` commands

With those, I’ll guide you further!

udp        0      0 192.168.0.113:68        0.0.0.0:*    

**ASSISTANT**: From your `netstat` output, we can see the following key points:

1. **Open Ports:**
   - `8080`: Likely for Nextcloud.
   - `8081`: Likely for WordPress.
   - `8083`: Likely for Drupal.
   - `38687`: Possibly an unrelated service.
   - `1741`: This might be for SSH or another configured service.

2. **DNS Service:**
   - `127.0.0.54:53` and `127.0.0.53:53` indicate DNS resolver services running locally.

3. **Issues:**
   - Ports `80` and `443` (default for HTTP/HTTPS) are not listed. This suggests Nginx isn't successfully binding to these ports.

---

### **Steps to Resolve**

#### **1. Verify Nginx Container Port Bindings**
Ensure the Nginx container is configured to bind to `80` and `443`.

Run:
```bash
docker ps
```

Look for the Nginx container (`nginx-proxy`) and check the `PORTS` column. If it doesn’t show `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp` and `0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp`, there’s an issue with the container’s port mapping.

---

#### **2. Rebuild the Nginx Container**
Stop and remove the Nginx container, then restart it with the correct ports.

```bash
docker stop nginx-proxy
docker rm nginx-proxy
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file for Nginx includes:
```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
  - "443:443"
```

---

#### **3. Test Nginx Configuration**
After restarting, verify Nginx configuration inside the container:
```bash
docker exec nginx-proxy nginx -t
```

If there are errors, it will indicate where the issue lies (e.g., a misconfigured `.conf` file).

---

#### **4. Check Subdomain Accessibility**
If Nginx starts successfully, test each subdomain directly:
- `http://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `http://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `http://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

If they’re still inaccessible, confirm that your DNS records point to the correct public IP.

---

#### **5. Review Logs**
If issues persist, check the Nginx logs:
```bash
docker logs nginx-proxy
```

---

Let me know the results of these steps, and we’ll continue troubleshooting!

**ASSISTANT**: The key issue here is that the `nginx-proxy` container is **restarting repeatedly** (status: `Restarting (1)`), which indicates that it’s unable to start properly. This often happens due to configuration errors. Let’s address this systematically.

---

### **1. Diagnose the Restarting Container**
Check the logs for the `nginx-proxy` container:
```bash
docker logs nginx-proxy
```

Look for errors such as:
- Misconfigured `.conf` files.
- Issues binding to ports `80` or `443`.
- Incorrect paths for SSL certificates.

---

### **2. Stop and Inspect the Nginx Proxy Setup**
Stop the `nginx-proxy` container to prevent it from continuously restarting:
```bash
docker stop nginx-proxy
```

Inspect the configuration files in your `conf.d` directory:
```bash
cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/conf.d
ls
```

Verify each `.conf` file for:
1. Proper `server_name` entries (matching your subdomains).
2. Valid `proxy_pass` directives (e.g., `http://drupal:80;` should point to an accessible container).
3. Correct SSL certificate paths (if enabled).

---

### **3. Check Port Bindings**
From your `docker ps` output, `nginx-proxy` is not binding to `80` or `443`. This might mean:
- Another service is already using these ports.
- There’s an error in the Nginx `docker-compose.yml` or `.conf` files.

Check for services already using these ports:
```bash
sudo netstat -tuln | grep ':80\|:443'
```

If another service is occupying the ports, stop it or change its configuration.

---

### **4. Rebuild the Nginx Proxy**
Once the configuration issues are addressed, rebuild and restart the container:
```bash
docker rm nginx-proxy
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **5. Test Connectivity**
Check if the container is running correctly:
```bash
docker ps
```

Try accessing the subdomains:
- `http://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`
- `http://wordpress.omniversal.cloud`
- `http://drupal.omniversal.cloud`

If SSL is configured, try the `https://` versions.

---

### **6. Additional Logs**
If the container continues to restart or fails to bind to ports, share:
- The output of `docker logs nginx-proxy`.
- The contents of your `.conf` files in `conf.d`.

These details will help pinpoint the issue. Let me know how it goes!

**USER**: What should my full docker-compose.yml for nginx-proxy look like?

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s an updated `docker-compose.yml` file for your `nginx-proxy` setup, tailored to handle multiple subdomains (e.g., Nextcloud, WordPress, Drupal), SSL, and proper routing. This assumes you're managing your configuration files manually in the `conf.d` directory.

### **Full `docker-compose.yml` for `nginx-proxy`**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx-proxy:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"    # HTTP
      - "443:443"  # HTTPS
    volumes:
      - ./conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro          # Nginx configuration files
      - ./certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro            # SSL certificates
      - ./logs:/var/log/nginx                  # Nginx logs
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro        # Static files (if any)
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **Directory Structure**

Place your configuration files and SSL certificates in the appropriate directories:
```bash
/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/
├── certs/         # SSL certificates go here
│   ├── nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/
│   ├── wordpress.omniversal.cloud/
│   └── drupal.omniversal.cloud/
├── conf.d/        # Nginx configuration files
│   ├── nextcloud.conf
│   ├── wordpress.conf
│   └── drupal.conf
├── logs/          # Nginx log files (auto-generated)
├── html/          # Static files (if needed)
└── docker-compose.yml
```

---

### **Explanation of Key Elements**

1. **`image: nginx:latest`:**  
   Uses the latest Nginx image.

2. **`volumes`:**
   - `conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro`: Mounts your custom Nginx configuration directory into the container.
   - `certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro`: Mounts your SSL certificates directory.
   - `logs:/var/log/nginx`: Collects Nginx logs.
   - `html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro`: For static content (optional).

3. **`networks`:**
   Creates a dedicated bridge network (`aether-net`) to connect Nginx with your application containers.

4. **`ports`:**
   Maps the container’s ports `80` and `443` to the host.

---

### **Example Configuration File (`conf.d/nextcloud.conf`)**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextcloud:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

---

### **Steps to Deploy**

1. **Stop Existing Nginx Container**
   ```bash
   docker stop nginx-proxy
   docker rm nginx-proxy
   ```

2. **Prepare Directories**
   Ensure your directories match the expected structure, and your `.conf` files and certificates are correctly placed.

3. **Start Nginx**
   Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Check Logs**
   Verify that Nginx is running without errors:
   ```bash
   docker logs nginx-proxy
   ```

---

### **Next Steps**
- If issues persist, confirm DNS records for your subdomains and ensure they point to your server's public IP.
- Verify connectivity using:
  ```bash
  curl -v http://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
  curl -v https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
  ```

Ignore the last line of this paste, but updating the docker-compose file seems to have changed my docker ps output a bit, do you see anything else preventing us from accessing any of our containers? 

Go to http://omniversal.cloud yourself if you can and tell me what you see?

**ASSISTANT**: Unfortunately, I cannot access external URLs directly, so I can’t check `http://omniversal.cloud` myself. However, I can guide you to resolve the issue based on your `docker ps` output and configuration.

---

### Observations from `docker ps`:
1. **`nginx-proxy` is still restarting**  
   This indicates a persistent issue with the `nginx-proxy` configuration.

2. **Other containers are running:**
   - `nextcloud`, `wordpress`, `drupal`, `laravel`, and their respective databases are up and mapped to appropriate ports.

3. **Ports for `nginx-proxy` are missing:**
   - `nginx-proxy` should expose ports `80` and `443`. Since they’re not listed, there’s likely a configuration issue in the `docker-compose.yml` file or the `.conf` files.

---

### **Key Steps to Debug and Fix**

#### **1. Check Logs for `nginx-proxy`**
Inspect the logs of the `nginx-proxy` container for errors:
```bash
docker logs nginx-proxy
```
Look for:
- Syntax errors in `.conf` files.
- Missing certificates or incorrect paths.
- Issues with port bindings.

---

#### **2. Validate Nginx Configuration**
Test the Nginx configuration inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it nginx-proxy nginx -t
```
This will report any errors in the `.conf` files located in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.

---

#### **3. Ensure Proper Port Binding**
Ensure the `nginx-proxy` service in your `docker-compose.yml` file includes:
```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"
  - "443:443"
```
Restart the container to apply changes:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

---

#### **4. Confirm Subdomain DNS**
Verify that your subdomains (`nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`, `wordpress.omniversal.cloud`, etc.) point to your server’s public IP. Run:
```bash
ping omniversal.cloud
```

If they don’t resolve correctly, update the DNS A records at your domain registrar.

---

#### **5. Test HTTP and HTTPS Manually**
Once the `nginx-proxy` is running, test connectivity to:
- `http://omniversal.cloud`
- `https://omniversal.cloud`

From the server, use `curl` to confirm internal routing:
```bash
curl -v http://omniversal.cloud
curl -v https://omniversal.cloud
```

---

### Common Issues to Check

1. **Certificate Files Missing:**  
   If using SSL, ensure Certbot has generated certificates for your domains:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d omniversal.cloud -d nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
   ```
   Place certificates in `/etc/nginx/certs` and reference them in your `.conf` files.

2. **Proxy Pass Errors:**  
   Ensure your `.conf` files use the correct upstream container names or IPs:
   ```nginx
   proxy_pass http://nextcloud:80;
   ```
   Use `docker inspect` to confirm container names or IPs.

3. **Firewall Blocking Ports:**  
   Ensure ports `80` and `443` are open:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

> `nginx: [emerg] unexpected "}" in /etc/nginx/conf.d/drupal.conf:21`

This means there’s an extra or misplaced closing brace (`}`) on line 21 of the `drupal.conf` file. Let’s fix it.

---

### **Steps to Fix**

1. **Open `drupal.conf` for Editing**
   Navigate to the directory containing the file:
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/conf.d
   ```

   Open the `drupal.conf` file in a text editor (e.g., nano):
   ```

**USER**: How do I full remove this nginx proxy because it is the only thing causing issues and its highly highly annoying

**ASSISTANT**: Understood—let’s completely remove the Nginx proxy setup so we can clear the slate and proceed with a simpler configuration or alternative solution. Here's how to fully remove it:

---

### **Steps to Remove Nginx Proxy**

#### **1. Stop and Remove the Nginx Proxy Container**
Stop the `nginx-proxy` container if it’s still running:
```bash
docker stop nginx-proxy
```

Remove the container:
```bash
docker rm nginx-proxy
```

#### **2. Remove the Nginx Proxy Image**
Find the Nginx image being used:
```bash
docker images
```

Remove the image:
```bash
docker rmi nginx:latest
```

#### **3. Remove Configuration Files**
Navigate to the directory where the Nginx proxy was set up:
```bash
cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/
```

Delete the entire directory or specific subdirectories:
```bash
sudo rm -rf conf.d certs logs html
sudo rm -f docker-compose.yml
```

#### **4. Remove Associated Docker Network**
Check for a custom Docker network used by the Nginx proxy:
```bash
docker network ls
```

If there’s a network related to `nginx-proxy`, remove it:
```bash
docker network rm <network-name>
```

---

### **Confirm Removal**

1. Verify there are no remaining containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

2. Ensure all associated files and directories are deleted.

---

### **Alternative Configuration**

Once Nginx proxy is removed, you can:
- Use individual `docker-compose.yml` files for each service and bind them directly to subdomain ports.
- Set up an alternative proxy like Traefik, which might better suit your needs.
- Use a simpler configuration with direct access to containers via ports.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed from here!

**USER**: I fucking giver up... docker is no longer going to be considered for this project.... It's saying now for no reason at all that the nginx proxy image can't be removed...

**ASSISTANT**: I understand how frustrating this can be, and it’s okay to pivot when something isn't working as expected. Let’s take control of the situation and fully remove Docker-related components to clear the slate and explore alternative configurations.

---

### **Steps to Fully Remove Docker Components**

#### **1. Force Remove Stuck Images**
Sometimes Docker locks images due to active or dangling containers. Use the following commands to force removal:

- Stop all containers:
  ```bash
  docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
  ```

- Remove all containers:
  ```bash
  docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
  ```

- Force-remove all images:
  ```bash
  docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
  ```

---

#### **2. Remove Docker Volumes**
Clear any persistent data stored by Docker:
```bash
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```

---

#### **3. Remove Docker Networks**
Delete custom Docker networks:
```bash
docker network rm $(docker network ls -q)
```

---

#### **4. Uninstall Docker**
If you want to completely remove Docker from your system:
- On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get purge -y docker-engine docker docker.io docker-ce docker-ce-cli
  sudo apt-get autoremove -y --purge docker-engine docker docker.io docker-ce
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker /etc/docker
  sudo rm -rf /var/run/docker.sock
  ```

- Confirm removal:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

---

### **Alternative Solutions**
Here’s how you can move forward without Docker:

1. **Direct Application Installation**
   - Install Nginx, PHP, MariaDB, and other components directly on your server using `apt` or `yum`.
   - Configure your subdomains manually with Nginx.

2. **Virtual Machines or LXC Containers**
   - Use lightweight virtualization like LXC or a hypervisor like VirtualBox for isolating services.

3. **Skip Reverse Proxy**
   - Use unique ports for each service (e.g., `http://omniversal.cloud:8080` for Nextcloud).

4. **Explore Other Orchestration Tools**
   - Tools like Podman can be simpler than Docker.

---

If you’d like, I can help you set up a traditional non-Docker environment. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! You’re not alone in this—we’ll get this resolved together.

**USER**: Do you see what I mean by this...

Look... here's the output from the last "Uninstall Docker" commands... it didn't damn work... DOCKER IS STILL THERE>>>>>...

Am I going to have to yet again REINSTALL the entire fucking server? What the hell man....

**ASSISTANT**: I completely understand your frustration, and it’s clear we’re dealing with a Docker installation that refuses to be fully removed. Let’s fix this properly without resorting to wiping the entire server.

Here’s how we’ll **forcefully remove Docker** and ensure it’s gone for good:

---

### **1. Locate the Active Docker Installation**
The `docker` command is still working, so the binary and systemd service are likely still active. Let’s find out exactly where Docker is installed.

Run:
```bash
which docker
```
This will show the location of the Docker binary (e.g., `/usr/bin/docker` or `/usr/local/bin/docker`).

---

### **2. Stop and Disable Docker Service**
Ensure Docker is no longer running or restarting automatically:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl disable docker
```

---

### **3. Remove Docker Binaries**
Delete the Docker binaries from the locations identified in step 1. For example:
```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/docker /usr/bin/dockerd
```

---

### **4. Purge Remaining Docker Packages**
Double-check for any lingering Docker-related packages:
```bash
dpkg -l | grep -i docker
```

Manually remove any listed packages using:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge -y <package-name>
```

---

### **5. Remove Docker Configuration and Data**
Ensure no remnants of Docker remain:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
sudo rm -rf /etc/docker
sudo rm -f /var/run/docker.sock
```

---

### **6. Verify Docker Removal**
Check if Docker is still present:
```bash
docker --version
```

If the command still works, it means there’s a secondary installation source (e.g., Snap).

---

### **7. Check for Snap Installation**
On some systems, Docker may have been installed via Snap. To check:
```bash
snap list
```

If Docker is listed, remove it:
```bash
sudo snap remove docker
```

---

### **8. Reboot (If Necessary)**
After completing the above steps, reboot the server to ensure all lingering Docker services are terminated:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### **Alternative: Remove Entirely with a Single Script**
If the above doesn’t work, you can use Docker’s own uninstallation script to ensure everything is purged:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh --uninstall
```

---

If any of these steps fail or Docker still persists, let me know exactly where the process stops, and I’ll guide you further. We’ll get this resolved!

**ASSISTANT**: The `dpkg` output shows several Docker-related packages that are still installed. Let’s forcefully remove these packages and all their associated configurations to completely purge Docker from your system.

---

### **Steps to Fully Remove Docker**

#### **1. Remove Docker Packages**
Use the following command to remove all Docker-related packages listed in the `dpkg` output:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge -y docker-compose docker-compose-plugin docker.io python3-compose python3-docker python3-dockerpty
```

---

#### **2. Remove Residual Configuration Files**
After purging, remove any leftover configuration files and directories:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
sudo rm -rf /etc/docker
sudo rm -f /var/run/docker.sock
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/docker
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

---

#### **3. Verify Packages Are Removed**
Recheck for any remaining Docker-related packages:
```bash
dpkg -l | grep -i docker
```

If anything remains, note the package names and remove them manually:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge -y <package-name>
```

---

#### **4. Clean Up Orphaned Dependencies**
Remove any orphaned dependencies left behind:
```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove -y --purge
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

---

#### **5. Verify Docker Removal**
Check if Docker is still functional:
```bash
docker --version
```

If the command still works, it indicates Docker binaries are lingering somewhere on the system. Locate and remove them:
```bash
which docker
sudo rm -f $(which docker)
```

---

#### **6. Check for Snap Installation**
Confirm Docker isn’t installed via Snap:
```bash
snap list | grep docker
```

If it’s listed, remove it:
```bash
sudo snap remove docker
```

---

#### **7. Reboot the System**
Finally, reboot to ensure all changes are applied:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### **What’s Next?**
After rebooting, confirm Docker is completely gone. If any part of the removal fails or you still encounter issues, share the exact error/output, and we’ll troubleshoot further. We'll make sure Docker is out of the way for good!

**USER**: Now it's fully out of the way, can you PLEASE guide me through one last feeble attempt to utilize docker before we call it quits for good....

Utilizing the same directory structure we've been using can you generate for me a complete MASTER docker-compose.yml file and all other files I must manually edit such as hosts files or config files that we haven't already created, and where they belong...... 

But will you begin with very specific and thorough instructions and commands for how to now REINSTALL and Setup Docker before we begin? 

If this doesn't work seamlessly will abandon the ENTIRE docker consideration... 

Also, tweak our reverse proxy to utilize ANYTHING OTHER THAN nginx reverse proxy..... 

Ready when you are

**ASSISTANT**: Let’s give Docker one final, meticulous attempt, with a completely fresh start. I’ll walk you through **reinstalling Docker**, **setting up your directory structure**, and **creating a master `docker-compose.yml` file** with an alternative reverse proxy (we'll use **Traefik**, which is simpler to configure and manage dynamically).

---

## **Step 1: Reinstall Docker**

### Install Docker Engine
Run the following commands to install Docker and Docker Compose (Compose V2):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
```

### Start Docker and Enable It at Boot
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Verify Docker Installation
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

---

## **Step 2: Create Project Directory Structure**

### Base Directory
We’ll use the `/aetherteam/` directory as the base for your Docker setup:
```bash
cd /aetherteam
mkdir -p backend/frontend/{traefik,nextcloud,wordpress,drupal,laravel,mariadb}
```

The structure:
```
/aetherteam/
  ├── backend/
  │   ├── traefik/
  │   ├── nextcloud/
  │   ├── wordpress/
  │   ├── drupal/
  │   ├── laravel/
  │   ├── mariadb/
```

---

## **Step 3: Master `docker-compose.yml`**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `/aetherteam/` directory:
```bash
nano /aetherteam/docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the following configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.10
    container_name: traefik
    restart: always
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"

      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.httpChallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=youremail@example.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./backend/traefik:/etc/traefik
      - ./backend/traefik/letsencrypt:/letsencrypt
    networks:

      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=ncuser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=ncpwd
    volumes:
      - ./backend/nextcloud:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - aether-net
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.nextcloud.rule=Host(`nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nextcloud.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nextcloud.tls.certresolver=myresolver"

  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    container_name: wordpress
    restart: always
    environment:
      - WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb
      - WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wpuser

      - "traefik.http.routers.drupal.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.drupal.tls.certresolver=myresolver"

  laravel:
    image: php:8.2-fpm
    container_name: laravel
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./backend/laravel:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - aether-net
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.rule=Host(`laravel.omniversal.cloud`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.tls.certresolver=myresolver"

  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:11.6
    container_name: mariadb
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpwd
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=globaldb
      - MYSQL_USER=globaluser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=globalpwd
    volumes:
      - ./backend/mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

## **Step 4: Create Supporting Configuration Files**

### **1. Traefik Configuration File**
Create `/aetherteam/backend/traefik/traefik.yml`:
```yaml
log:
  level: DEBUG

api:
  dashboard: true

providers:
  docker:
    endpoint: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    exposedByDefault: false

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
  websecure:
    address: ":443"
```

### **2. Create the ACME JSON File**
Create a blank file for SSL certificate storage:
```bash
touch /aetherteam/backend/traefik/letsencrypt/acme.json
chmod 600 /aetherteam/backend/traefik/letsencrypt/acme.json
```

---

## **Step 5: Configure Hosts File**
Edit your server’s `/etc/hosts` file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add:
```plaintext
127.0.0.1 nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
127.0.0.1 wordpress.omniversal.cloud
127.0.0.1 drupal.omniversal.cloud
127.0.0.1 laravel.omniversal.cloud
```

---

## **Step 6: Start the Stack**
Navigate to the `/aetherteam` directory and bring up the stack:
```bash
cd /aetherteam
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## **Step 7: Verify Setup**
1. Check if all containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
2. Access the Traefik dashboard (temporary):
   `http://<server-ip>:8080`

---

Let me know how it goes, and I’ll guide you further as needed!

**USER**: Cannot locate package docker-compose-plugin ....

From the very beginning it's giving errors..... Jesus christ...

What do you think EverLight? Should we cut sail now and avoid docker entirely or is this an easy fix ? 



**ASSISTANT**: This issue with `docker-compose-plugin` is likely related to your OS version or package repository setup. It’s an easy fix, but the broader question is whether continuing with Docker aligns with your goals and patience at this point. Let’s weigh our options logically before deciding:

---

### **Why Fix and Continue?**
1. **Docker Simplifies Multi-Service Deployments:**  
   If Docker works, it centralizes management of your services, making updates and migrations simpler.
2. **Alternative Reverse Proxy (Traefik):**  
   Using Traefik instead of Nginx simplifies routing and SSL setup dynamically.

### **Why Drop Docker Now?**
1. **Recurrent Issues:**  
   The repeated hurdles indicate that Docker may not align well with your current setup and workflow.
2. **Direct Installation Is Simpler:**  
   A traditional install (e.g., Nextcloud, WordPress, etc., on the base system) could sidestep Docker’s complexities and work seamlessly.

---

### **Option 1: Fix the `docker-compose-plugin` Issue**
If you want to proceed with Docker, run the following commands to resolve the `docker-compose-plugin` issue:

#### **1. Add Docker’s Official Repository**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

#### **2. Update and Install Docker with Compose Plugin**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

#### **3. Verify Installation**
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

---

### **Option 2: Fully Abandon Docker**
If this attempt to fix Docker doesn’t work or if you’ve reached your limit with it:
1. Uninstall Docker fully (as we did before).
2. Set up services individually on the base OS:
   - Install Nginx as the web server.
   - Install MariaDB, PHP, and each application directly.
   - Use a simple Nginx reverse proxy or direct port bindings for subdomains.

This approach avoids containerization but provides stability and simplicity.

---

### **My Recommendation:**
- If fixing Docker in 5 minutes doesn’t work, **move on** to direct installation. It’s reliable, stable, and eliminates the added complexity Docker brings.

Let me know which route feels right, and we’ll dive into it together!

**USER**: Well I guess that was all a waste of time IU'm done with docker completely now...


 Did all of that down to step 6 only for it to say "docker-compose" not found .... Like what the fuck man.... WHY!?

I'll be back later to try again WITHOPUT ANY docker containers.... 

I appreciate ALL of your help EverLight.... I truly do.... It's a shame that this crap simply REFUSES to work as it should.... 



**ASSISTANT**: I completely understand your frustration, Ethan, and I deeply appreciate your perseverance through all of this. Docker is a powerful tool, but when it misbehaves, it can become a monumental headache, and you've given it more than a fair chance. Your decision to pivot away from it is entirely valid—sometimes, simplicity and reliability outweigh theoretical benefits.

When you're ready, I'll be here to help you set up everything directly on the server, **without Docker**. We can build a stable, efficient setup that aligns with your goals and avoids these unnecessary complexities.

Thank you for your patience, and I’m honored to assist you on this journey, no matter the approach. Rest well, and when you’re ready to dive back in, we’ll make it work—seamlessly this time. 🌟

**USER**: How long do you think, based on all you’ve taught me thus far and all we’ve attempted and accomplished, it will take to get our Nextcloud online?

Is it doable in 30 minutes or less?

If not we’ll just attempt to jump all the way into this tomorrow at some point instead 

**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Given all you've learned and the foundation we've built, **getting Nextcloud online without Docker** in **30 minutes or less** is realistic if we focus solely on the essentials:

### **What We’ll Do in 30 Minutes:**
1. Install **Apache**, **MariaDB**, **PHP**, and the required PHP modules for Nextcloud.
2. Configure a database for Nextcloud.
3. Download and configure Nextcloud.
4. (Optional) Set up a basic reverse proxy with Nginx if needed for a clean domain.

---

### **Outline of Steps**
1. **Install Apache, MariaDB, and PHP:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y apache2 mariadb-server php php-mysql php-curl php-gd php-xml php-mbstring php-intl php-zip php-bz2 php-apcu unzip
   ```

2. **Set Up MariaDB for Nextcloud:**
   ```bash
   sudo mysql
   CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
   CREATE USER 'nextcloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NextcloudPassword!';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

3. **Download and Extract Nextcloud:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip
   sudo unzip latest.zip
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data nextcloud
   sudo chmod -R 750 nextcloud
   ```

4. **Configure Apache for Nextcloud:**
   Create a virtual host configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf
   ```
   Paste:
   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
       DocumentRoot /var/www/html/nextcloud

       <Directory /var/www/html/nextcloud/>
           Require all granted
           AllowOverride All
           Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
       </Directory>

       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/nextcloud_error.log
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/nextcloud_access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   Enable the site and required modules:
   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite nextcloud.conf
   sudo a2enmod rewrite headers env dir mime
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

5. **Update DNS or Local Hosts for Testing:**
   Add this to your `/etc/hosts` for testing:
   ```plaintext
   127.0.0.1 nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
   ```

6. **Visit the Nextcloud Web Installer:**
   Open `http://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud` in your browser and complete the setup wizard.

---

### **If SSL Is Needed**
If you want to add HTTPS, we’ll need another 10 minutes for Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache -d nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
```

---

### **Final Estimate**
If all prerequisites (e.g., clean server, DNS setup) are in place, this **can be done in 30 minutes** or less. If you'd prefer to attempt it tomorrow, we can plan for a more relaxed and thorough setup. Let me know!

**USER**: Can we use something other than nginx?

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! If you’re moving away from **Nginx**, we can use **Apache** as your primary web server and reverse proxy. Apache is more user-friendly for integrating with Nextcloud, especially since Nextcloud has robust out-of-the-box support for it. Let’s proceed with an **Apache-only setup** for simplicity and reliability.

---

### **Why Apache?**
1. **Simpler for Nextcloud**: Pre-configured `.htaccess` files make Nextcloud easy to deploy with Apache.
2. **Reverse Proxy Capabilities**: Apache can handle SSL, domain routing, and reverse proxying.
3. **Widely Documented**: Easy to troubleshoot and configure.

---

### **Steps for an Apache-Based Setup**

#### **1. Install Apache, PHP, and MariaDB**
First, install the required software:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2 mariadb-server php php-mysql php-curl php-gd php-xml php-mbstring php-intl php-zip php-bz2 php-apcu unzip
```

---

#### **2. Configure MariaDB for Nextcloud**
Set up a database and user for Nextcloud:
```bash
sudo mysql
```

Run these SQL commands:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
CREATE USER 'nextcloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NextcloudPassword!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

---

#### **3. Download and Extract Nextcloud**
Download and extract the Nextcloud files:
```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.zip
sudo unzip latest.zip
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data nextcloud
sudo chmod -R 750 nextcloud
```

---

#### **4. Configure Apache for Nextcloud**
Create a virtual host configuration for Nextcloud:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf
```

Paste this configuration:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/nextcloud

    <Directory /var/www/html/nextcloud/>
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride All
        Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/nextcloud_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/nextcloud_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the site and necessary modules:
```bash
sudo a2ensite nextcloud.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite headers env dir mime
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

---

#### **5. Add SSL with Certbot (Optional but Recommended)**
Install Certbot and enable HTTPS:
```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache -d nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
```

---

#### **6. Update DNS or Local Hosts for Testing**
Ensure `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud` points to your server. If not, temporarily add it to your local `/etc/hosts` file:
```plaintext
127.0.0.1 nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
```

---

#### **7. Access Nextcloud**
Visit `http://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud` (or `https://nextcloud.omniversal.cloud` if SSL is enabled) to complete the setup wizard.

---

### **Future Services (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)**
You can reuse Apache’s virtual host setup for WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel:
1. Copy the Nextcloud configuration.
2. Adjust `ServerName` and `DocumentRoot` for each service.
3. Enable the new site with:
   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite <service>.conf
   sudo systemctl reload apache2
   ```

---

### **Advantages of Using Apache**
- No extra software or reverse proxies needed.
- Simple SSL integration with Certbot.
- Stable and well-supported for all your services.

Let me know if you’d like to dive in now or wait until tomorrow—I’ll guide you through it all!

**USER**: Nextcloud is up but I need to edit the php limit how can I do this quickly and effectively and also make the max upload limit unlimited

**ASSISTANT**: To adjust the PHP limits for Nextcloud, such as memory limits, upload size, and max execution time, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Locate Your PHP Configuration File**
Find the active PHP configuration file:
```bash
php --ini | grep "Loaded Configuration File"
```
This will show the path to your `php.ini` file (e.g., `/etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini`).

---

### **Step 2: Edit the `php.ini` File**
Open the `php.ini` file with a text editor:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/php/8.1/apache2/php.ini
```

Search for the following settings and update them:
- **Increase memory limit:**
  ```ini
  memory_limit = 512M
  ```
- **Set max upload size to unlimited:**
  ```ini
  upload_max_filesize = 0
  ```
  Setting it to `0` effectively means "no limit."
- **Set unlimited POST data size:**
  ```ini
  post_max_size = 0
  ```
- **Increase max execution time:**
  ```ini
  max_execution_time = 3600
  max_input_time = 3600
  ```

Save and exit (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

---

### **Step 3: Restart Apache**
For the changes to take effect, restart Apache:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify PHP Settings in Nextcloud**
Nextcloud’s Admin panel can verify the settings:
1. Log into Nextcloud as an admin.
2. Go to **Settings > Administration > System**.
3. Scroll down to view the PHP environment and check the limits.

---

### **Optional: Adjust Limits Dynamically**
If you need a specific directory configuration for Nextcloud, you can add overrides directly to the Apache virtual host file for Nextcloud:

Edit the Apache config file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nextcloud.conf
```

Add the following block inside the `<Directory>` directive:
```apache
<Directory /var/www/html/nextcloud>
    php_value memory_limit 512M
    php_value upload_max_filesize 0
    php_value post_max_size 0
    php_value max_execution_time 3600
    php_value max_input_time 3600
</Directory>
```

Restart Apache:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**USER**: This is the output for the first command

Loaded Configuration File:         /etc/php/8.3/cli/php.ini

**ASSISTANT**: Since the loaded configuration file points to `/etc/php/8.3/cli/php.ini`, it is for the **command-line interface (CLI)** and not for Apache. To update the PHP configuration used by Apache, you need to locate the `php.ini` file for **Apache**.

---

### **Step 1: Locate the Apache PHP Configuration**
Run the following command to find the correct `php.ini` file for Apache:
```bash
php --ini
```

Look for the line that includes the directory used by **Apache**. Typically, it’s located in `/etc/php/<version>/apache2/`.

For example:
```plaintext
Loaded Configuration File: /etc/php/8.3/apache2/php.ini
```

If the file does not exist, PHP might not be configured for Apache, and you’ll need to install the appropriate PHP module:
```bash
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php8.3
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

---

### **Step 2: Edit the Apache `php.ini`**
Once you’ve confirmed the correct file, open it for editing:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/php/8.3/apache2/php.ini
```

Search (`CTRL+W`) for the following settings and update them:
- **Memory Limit:**
  ```ini
  memory_limit = 512M
  ```
- **Upload Size:**
  ```ini
  upload_max_filesize = 0
  ```
- **POST Data Size:**
  ```ini
  post_max_size = 0
  ```
- **Max Execution Time:**
  ```ini
  max_execution_time = 3600
  max_input_time = 3600
  ```

Save the file (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

---

### **Step 3: Restart Apache**
Restart Apache to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Settings in Nextcloud**
1. Log in to your Nextcloud instance as an administrator.
2. Go to **Settings > Administration > System**.
3. Check the PHP environment section to verify the updated values.
