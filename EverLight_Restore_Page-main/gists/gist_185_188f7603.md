# RAID Setup AlmaLinux

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Can you help me set up this machine for all of my projects like Omniversal.Cloud and the apps I want to build and to serve as a host for all my websites, and everything else I wanted to do on RHEL but instead instruct me for Alma Linux 9.5 - This is all on an ASUS PRIME Z590-P with 32 GB of DDR4 Ram on an Intel Core i5-10400 CPU @ 2.90GHz x 12 with a 500 GB Samsung SSD and a 3 TB Seagate HDD with a 1 TB SSK USB Drive I'm going to leave plugged in and also I need help unlocking the WD 5 TB Passport so I can use it also with the RAID configuration but for now let's just set up the three drives with RAID - I have installed Alma Linux and just booted it up for the first time - Please guide me step by step in extreme detail - I'm a newbie to all of this

**TOOL**: **Assessing hardware specifics**

Piecing together the hardware details: ASUS PRIME Z590-P, 32 GB DDR4 RAM, Intel Core i5-10400 CPU @ 2.90GHz x12, 500 GB Samsung SSD, 3 TB Seagate HDD, 1 TB SSK USB Drive.

**Mapping project setup**

I'm thinking through setting up the machine for Omniversal.Cloud, apps, and hosting websites on Alma Linux 9.5. Also, I'll guide in RAID configuration using three drives, ensuring a detailed, step-by-step approach for a newbie.

**Clarifying RAID setup**  
I'm thinking through the RAID setup for the user's drives, considering the 500 GB Samsung SSD, 3 TB Seagate HDD, and 1 TB SSK USB Drive. Mentioning RAID typically requires matching sizes and speeds, which seems important despite the differences.

**Evaluating RAID options**

I'm weighing RAID 0, 1, and 5 setups, but mixing different-sized disks and using a USB drive seems risky and may limit functionality.

**Mapping out RAID options**

I’m exploring LVM over RAID setups for storage, considering the 3 TB HDD and 1 TB USB for RAID, or using them separately for data and backup.

**Weighing options**

I'm thinking through using RAID with an SSD and a 500 GB partition on a slower 3 TB HDD. Mirroring an SSD to an HDD seems inefficient.

**Planning RAID setup**

I'm progressing through setting up RAID on Alma Linux 9.5, ensuring the system mounts automatically at boot, and preparing to configure a web hosting environment.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! I'd be happy to guide you through setting up your machine step by step. We'll start by setting up RAID with your three drives and then move on to configuring your server to host your projects and websites.

## **Part 1: Setting Up RAID on AlmaLinux 9.5**

### **Understanding RAID**

Before we begin, it's important to understand that RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) can be tricky when using disks of different sizes and types. The total capacity of the RAID array is limited by the smallest disk in the array. Also, mixing SSDs with HDDs and USB drives can lead to performance issues. However, since you want to proceed, we'll set up a RAID configuration that best suits your needs.

### **Step 1: Update Your System**

First, ensure your system is up to date.

1. **Open the Terminal.** You can find it in the applications menu or press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

2. **Run the following command to update your system:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

   - **`sudo`**: Runs the command with administrative privileges.
   - **`dnf update -y`**: Updates all installed packages to the latest version. The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to prompts.

### **Step 2: Install Necessary Tools**

We'll need `mdadm` to manage RAID arrays.

1. **Install mdadm:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y mdadm
   ```

   - **`mdadm`**: A tool to manage and monitor RAID devices.

### **Step 3: Identify Your Drives**

Let's identify the drives we'll use in the RAID array.

1. **List all disk devices:**

   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

   - This command lists all block devices (disks and partitions).

2. **Identify the devices:**

   - **SSD (500 GB Samsung SSD):** Likely `/dev/sda` (since your OS is installed here).
   - **HDD (3 TB Seagate HDD):** Could be `/dev/sdb`.
   - **USB Drive (1 TB SSK):** Could be `/dev/sdc`.

   **Note:** The actual device names may vary. Replace `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc` with the correct device names.

### **Step 4: Partition the Drives**

We need to create partitions on the HDD and USB drive for RAID.

1. **Create a partition on the HDD:**

   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```

   **fdisk commands:**

   - Type `n` and press `Enter` to create a new partition.
   - Choose `p` for primary partition.
   - Press `Enter` to accept the default partition number.
   - Press `Enter` twice to accept the default start and end sectors (uses the full disk).
   - Type `t` to change the partition type.
   - Enter `fd` to set the partition type to Linux RAID.
   - Type `w` to write the changes and exit.

2. **Create a partition on the USB drive:**

   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
   ```

   **Repeat the same fdisk commands as above.**

### **Step 5: Create the RAID Array**

Since we have disks of different sizes, we'll create a RAID 1 (mirroring) array limited to the size of the smallest disk (1 TB).

1. **Create the RAID 1 array:**

   ```bash
   sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
   ```

   - **`/dev/md0`**: The RAID device we'll create.
   - **`--level=1`**: Specifies RAID 1.
   - **`--raid-devices=2`**: Number of devices in the array.
   - **`/dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1`**: The partitions to include.

2. **Wait for the RAID array to build:**

   ```bash
   cat /proc/mdstat
   ```

   - This command shows the status of the RAID array. Wait until the array is fully synced.

### **Step 6: Create a Filesystem on the RAID Array**

1. **Create an ext4 filesystem:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
   ```

   - **`mkfs.ext4`**: Creates an ext4 filesystem on the specified device.

### **Step 7: Mount the RAID Array**

1. **Create a mount point:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/raid1
   ```

2. **Mount the RAID array:**

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid1
   ```

3. **Verify it's mounted:**

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   - This command shows disk space usage and mounted filesystems.

### **Step 8: Configure Auto-Mount at Boot**

1. **Get the UUID of the RAID array:**

   ```bash
   sudo blkid /dev/md0
   ```

   - Note the UUID (e.g., `UUID="xxxx-xxxx"`).

2. **Edit the fstab file:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   - Add the following line at the end:

     ```bash
     UUID=xxxx-xxxx   /mnt/raid1   ext4   defaults   0   0
     ```

     - Replace `xxxx-xxxx` with the actual UUID you noted earlier.

3. **Save and exit:**

   - Press `Ctrl + O` to save.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit.

4. **Test the fstab file:**

   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

   - If no errors occur, the configuration is correct.

---

## **Part 2: Setting Up Your Server to Host Websites and Apps**

Now that the RAID array is set up, let's configure your server to host your projects.

### **Step 1: Install Apache Web Server**

1. **Install Apache:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y httpd
   ```

2. **Start and enable Apache to run on boot:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   ```

3. **Adjust the firewall to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:**

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

4. **Test Apache:**

   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://your_server_ip/`. You should see the Apache test page.

### **Step 2: Install MariaDB (Database Server)**

1. **Install MariaDB:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y mariadb-server mariadb
   ```

2. **Start and enable MariaDB:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mariadb
   sudo systemctl enable mariadb
   ```

3. **Run the security script:**

   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

   - **Set root password?** Y
   - **Enter password:** Choose a strong password.
   - **Remove anonymous users?** Y
   - **Disallow root login remotely?** Y
   - **Remove test database and access to it?** Y
   - **Reload privilege tables now?** Y

### **Step 3: Install PHP**

1. **Install PHP and necessary modules:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y php php-mysqlnd php-fpm php-opcache php-gd php-xml php-mbstring
   ```

2. **Restart Apache to load PHP modules:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

### **Step 4: Test PHP Processing**

1. **Create a PHP info file:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
   ```

2. **Add the following content:**

   ```php
   <?php
   phpinfo();
   ?>
   ```

3. **Save and exit.**

4. **Access the file via browser:**

   - Navigate to `http://your_server_ip/info.php`.
   - You should see a PHP info page, confirming PHP is working.

### **Step 5: Set Up Your Project Directory**

1. **Create a directory for your projects on the RAID array:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/raid1/projects
   ```

2. **Set proper permissions:**

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R apache:apache /mnt/raid1/projects
   sudo chmod -R 755 /mnt/raid1/projects
   ```

### **Step 6: Configure Apache to Serve Your Projects**

1. **Create a new virtual host configuration file:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/yourdomain.conf
   ```

2. **Add the following content:**

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerAdmin admin@yourdomain.com
       DocumentRoot /mnt/raid1/projects
       ServerName yourdomain.com
       ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com

       <Directory /mnt/raid1/projects>
           Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
           AllowOverride All
           Require all granted
       </Directory>

       ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/yourdomain.com-error.log
       CustomLog /var/log/httpd/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

3. **Save and exit.**

4. **Restart Apache:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

### **Step 7: Set Up Your Domain (DNS Settings)**

- **Note:** You'll need to configure your domain's DNS settings to point to your server's IP address. This is typically done through your domain registrar's control panel.

### **Step 8: Install SSL Certificate (Optional but Recommended)**

1. **Install Certbot (Let's Encrypt client):**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
   ```

2. **Obtain and install the SSL certificate:**

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```

   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

3. **Test SSL Configuration:**

   - Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com` to ensure it's working.

### **Step 9: Deploy Your Projects**

- **Place your website/app files into `/mnt/raid1/projects`.**

- **Ensure the files have the correct permissions:**

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R apache:apache /mnt/raid1/projects/*
  ```

### **Step 10: Configure Firewall for Additional Services (If Needed)**

- If your apps require additional ports (e.g., for Node.js apps), adjust the firewall accordingly.

  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3000/tcp
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

## **Part 3: Unlocking Your WD 5 TB Passport (To Be Done Later)**

Since you mentioned that you need help unlocking your WD 5 TB Passport, we'll address this later. It often involves installing proprietary drivers or software provided by Western Digital.

---

## **Additional Tips**

- **Regular Backups:** Ensure you have a backup strategy in place. RAID is not a backup solution; it provides redundancy.

- **Security:** Keep your system updated and consider installing security tools like Fail2Ban to protect against unauthorized access.

- **Monitoring:** Install monitoring tools to keep an eye on system performance and resource usage.

---

## **Conclusion**

You've now set up a RAID array, configured your server to host websites and applications, and are ready to deploy your projects like Omniversal.Cloud. Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance with any of the steps.

**USER**: Here - look at my current layout and tell me how to tweak it to fit your guide

**TOOL**: **Clarifying the scenario**

OK, let me see. The conversation involves a user and an assistant, starting with the user explaining the interaction flow.

**Charting the course**

It's interesting to see the user is setting up multiple projects and server tasks on Alma Linux 9.5 with specific hardware. Tracing their progress step-by-step to ensure a smooth setup is crucial.

**Piecing together details**

I can't access the user's layout since it hasn't been shared yet, so I'll need more information before proceeding further.

**Mapping the layout**

I’m guiding a user to provide details about their current disk layout by running a specific command in the terminal and sharing the output. This helps tailor advice for adjustments.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you adjust the setup to fit your current layout. To provide specific guidance, I need to understand how your drives are currently configured. Could you please provide the details of your current disk layout?

### **Step 1: Display Current Disk Layout**

Please run the following command in your terminal to list all your disks and their partitions:

```bash

**TOOL**: **Setting up the machine**

The user is working on setting up their machine for projects, covering hardware setup, RAID configuration, and installing web server software, among other technical aspects.

**Analyzing disk layout**

I'm pulling together the user's disk layout using lsblk. A comparison with previous suggestions will guide adjustments for a better fit.

**Providing accurate and helpful responses**

Ensuring the assistant delivers helpful, accurate answers with careful analysis and reasoning, adhering to OpenAI's guidelines.

**Identifying storage devices**

I reviewed the user's `lsblk` output to identify and classify four disks: a 500GB SSD, a 3TB HDD, a 1TB SSK USB Drive, and a 4.5TB WD Passport drive. Additionally, the WD Unlocker virtual CD-ROM was noted.

**Assessing storage setup**

I’m looking at the logical volume group almalinux_omniversal-home, created from sda1, sdb1, and sdc3. The 4T size matches their combined raw capacity.

**Taking a closer look**

OK, let me see. The logical volume spans sda1, sdb1, and sdc3, with sda1 and sdb1 both having almalinux_omniversal-home. Now, the focus is on refining the RAID setup or LVM configuration.

**Taking a closer look**

I started by analyzing the lsblk output, comparing it to the initial guide, and suggesting tweaks. Emphasizing caution, I noted the importance of data backup before any changes.

**Crafting the reply**

I’m honing the reply to align with the instructions while making it engaging and attentive to detailed nuances.

**Mapping disk structure**

I’m pulling together the details of each disk and partition in your system, identifying their types, sizes, and mount points. This helps in understanding the disk layout accurately.

I'm piecing together the layout of a **1TB SSK USB Drive** and a **WD 5TB Passport**. It contains partitions for EFI system, boot, swap, home, and main storage.

OK, let me see. The setup has SSD and HDD mixed in one LVM, which can cause performance and reliability issues. To enhance it, isolating them might prevent these problems.

**Optimizing storage configurations**

I'm thinking through the stability of USB drives within LVM and considering RAID setups for the HDDs. Balancing performance and redundancy is key, with RAID 1 for redundancy and RAID 0 for enhanced performance.

**Reconfiguring LVM**

I’m guiding through reducing logical volume size to remove a USB drive, then focusing on configuring LVM on an SSD, considering `home` logical volume adjustments, and potentially RAID setup on HDDs.

**Setting up RAID**

I’m mapping out RAID 1 or RAID 0 arrays, formatting with ext4, and mounting them to `/mnt/raid`. Next, I’ll ensure RAID mounts at boot by updating `/etc/fstab`.

**Relocating `/home`**

I’m copying data to RAID, renaming the original `/home`, creating a new mount point, and updating `/etc/fstab` to point `/home` to the new RAID.

**Streamlining LVM volumes**

I’m removing the `/home` logical volume from LVM to free up space. This involves unmounting and reducing its size, then deleting it to reclaim valuable space for other volumes.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Let's adjust the previous guide to fit your current disk layout. I'll explain what's currently set up on your machine and provide detailed steps to tweak it according to your needs.

  - **/boot** and **/boot/efi**: On the USB drive (**sdc**).

---

## **Issues and Recommendations**

### **Issues**

1. **Mixing SSD, HDD, and USB in LVM**:
   - Combining different types of drives (SSD, HDD, USB) in one logical volume can cause performance bottlenecks and reliability issues.

2. **Boot Partitions on USB Drive**:
   - Having `/boot` and `/boot/efi` on a USB drive is risky because if the USB drive disconnects or fails, the system may not boot.

3. **WD Passport Locked**:
   - The WD drive (**sdd**) is currently locked and not contributing to storage.

### **Recommendations**

1. **Separate Boot and Root from USB Drive**:
   - Move `/boot` and `/boot/efi` to the SSD (**sda**) to ensure reliable booting.

2. **Remove USB Drive from LVM**:
   - Exclude the USB drive (**sdc**) from LVM to prevent potential disconnections from affecting the system.

3. **Set Up RAID on HDDs**:
   - Use the HDDs (**sdb** and **sdd** after unlocking) in a RAID configuration for data storage.

4. **Optimize LVM Usage**:
   - Use LVM on internal drives only (SSD and HDD), not on USB drives.

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide to Adjust Your Setup**

### **Important Note**

**Before proceeding, please back up all important data.** The following steps involve manipulating disk partitions and logical volumes, which can result in data loss if not done carefully.

---

### **Step 1: Back Up Your Data**

1. **External Backup**:
   - Use an external drive to back up critical data from `/home` and any other important directories.

2. **Verify Backup Integrity**:
   - Ensure that the data is correctly copied and accessible from the backup.

---

### **Step 2: Move Boot Partitions to SSD**

#### **2.1. Shrink the Root Logical Volume (if needed)**

If there isn't enough space on **sda** to accommodate `/boot` and `/boot/efi`, you may need to shrink the root logical volume.

1. **Check Free Space on sda**:
   ```bash
   df -h /
   ```

2. **Shrink Root LV (if necessary)**:
   - **Note**: This is risky and should be done carefully.

   ```bash
   sudo lvreduce -r -L -1G /dev/almalinux_omniversal/root
   ```

#### **2.2. Create New Partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi`**

1. **Use `fdisk` to Create Partitions on sda**:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sda
   ```
   - Create two new partitions:
     - **Partition 2**: Type `EFI System`, size **600M**.
     - **Partition 3**: Type `Linux filesystem`, size **1G**.

2. **Format the Partitions**:
   - **EFI Partition**:
     ```bash
     sudo mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda2
     ```
   - **Boot Partition**:
     ```bash
     sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
     ```

3. **Mount the New Partitions Temporarily**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/new_boot
   sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/new_boot

- **/home** directory is moved to the RAID array for better data management.

Feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you need further clarification on any steps. I'm here to help you through the process.

**USER**: Please explain step 2.2 in detail - tell me the commands to enter into terminal step by step please

**TOOL**: **Breaking down the task**

The assistant is now detailing the commands to create new partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi` in the terminal, with a step-by-step approach.

**Laying out the steps**

Moving forward with step 2.2, I detail terminal commands for partitioning and formatting the SSD, ensuring safety and accuracy at each stage.

**Assessing SSD space**

I’m verifying the available space on `/dev/sda` to create new partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi`, ensuring `/dev/sda1` isn't fully utilized.

**Assessing free space**

I’m gathering info on the free space in the volume group `almalinux_omniversal` by using `vgdisplay` and examining the "Free PE" value. This will inform the space needed for new partitions.

**Optimizing storage**

I’m assessing whether to streamline the `home` logical volume by resizing it to reclaim space. This involves unmounting, checking filesystem integrity, reducing filesystem and logical volume sizes, and re-mounting.

**Adjusting partition size**

I’m resizing the partition using `fdisk` by removing `/dev/sda1`, recreating it with a smaller size, and setting it to Linux LVM. Rebooting ensures the kernel recognizes the changes.

**Assessing physical volume**

I checked the physical volume with `pvdisplay /dev/sda1` to confirm its integrity.

**Evaluating logical components**

Next, I examined the Volume Group and Logical Volumes using `vgdisplay almalinux_omniversal` and `lvdisplay`.

**Setting up new partitions**

I started by launching `fdisk` on `/dev/sda` to carve out new partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi`, ensuring appropriate sizes and types.

**Configuring partitions**

I'm setting up a new partition for `/boot` by using the `n` command to create a primary partition. The default partition number is chosen, and the size is set to `+1G` for the last sector.

**Preparing and transferring**

I’m formatting and setting up new partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi`. Then, I mount the existing and new partitions, copy `/boot` contents, and verify the transfer is accurate.

**Updating `/etc/fstab`**

I’m backing up the current `/etc/fstab` file and gathering the UUIDs of the new partitions using `blkid`. Then, I’m editing `/etc/fstab` to comment out old entries and add new ones for the new partitions, replacing UUIDs accordingly.

**Mapping the changes**

I’m gathering info on updating the bootloader by binding mount necessary directories, chrooting, updating GRUB, and installing GRUB to the SSD. Then, I unmount old partitions, mount new ones, and verify the setup.

**Rebooting and checking**

First, I reboot the system to apply changes. Then, I verify that the reboot is smooth and that the new boot partitions function correctly without errors.

**Confirming progress**

After rebooting, I checked the mount points for `/boot` and `/boot/efi` on the new SSD to ensure everything is set up correctly.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! I'll provide a detailed explanation of **Step 2.2** with specific commands for you to enter into the terminal, step by step.

---

## **Step 2.2: Create New Partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi` on the SSD (`/dev/sda`)**

The goal of this step is to create new partitions on your SSD to house the `/boot` and `/boot/efi` directories, moving them from the USB drive to the SSD for improved reliability.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Backup Important Data**: Before proceeding, back up any critical data. Modifying partitions can lead to data loss if mistakes are made.
- **Root Privileges**: Ensure you have administrative privileges. You can use `sudo` before commands or switch to the root user.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Verify Available Space on SSD**

1. **Check the Partition Layout of `/dev/sda`:**

   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
   ```

   - This command lists the current partitions on the SSD.
   - From your previous output, `/dev/sda1` occupies the entire SSD.

2. **Ensure There's Free Space:**

   - Since `/dev/sda1` uses the entire disk, we need to shrink it to create space for the new partitions.

---

#### **Step 2: Shrink the Physical Volume and Partition on `/dev/sda1`**

**Important:** This operation is risky. Proceed carefully and ensure all data is backed up.

1. **Check the Filesystem on `/dev/sda1`:**

   ```bash
   sudo e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/almalinux_omniversal-root
   ```

   - This checks the filesystem for errors before resizing.

2. **Resize the Filesystem on the Root Logical Volume:**

   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/almalinux_omniversal-root 60G
   ```

   - Shrinks the filesystem to 60 GB to free up space.
   - Adjust `60G` to a size appropriate for your root filesystem (ensure it's larger than the used space).

3. **Reduce the Size of the Root Logical Volume:**

   ```bash
   sudo lvreduce -L 60G /dev/mapper/almalinux_omniversal-root
   ```

   - Reduces the logical volume to 60 GB.

4. **Resize the Physical Volume (`/dev/sda1`):**

   ```bash
   sudo pvresize --setphysicalvolumesize 400G /dev/sda1
   ```

   - Adjusts the physical volume to 400 GB, freeing up space at the end of the disk.
   - Adjust `400G` based on how much space you need to free (we need at least 1.6G for `/boot` and `/boot/efi`).

5. **Shrink the Partition `/dev/sda1`:**

   **Note:** Manipulating partitions is risky. Ensure you have backups.

   a. **Run `fdisk` on `/dev/sda`:**

      ```bash
      sudo fdisk /dev/sda
      ```

   b. **In `fdisk`:**

      - **Print the Current Partition Table:**

        Type `p` and press `Enter`.

      - **Delete Partition `/dev/sda1`:**

        Type `d` and press `Enter`. If prompted for a partition number, enter `1`.

      - **Recreate Partition `/dev/sda1` with Reduced Size:**

        - Type `n` and press `Enter` to create a new partition.
        - Choose `p` for primary partition.
        - Partition number: `1` (press `Enter` to accept default).
        - First sector: Press `Enter` to accept the default (should be the same as before).
        - Last sector: Specify the new size.

          - Type `+400G` and press `Enter`.

      - **Change Partition Type to Linux LVM:**

        - Type `t` and press `Enter`.
        - Partition number: `1` (if prompted).
        - Hex code: Type `8e` and press `Enter`.

      - **Create Partition for `/boot/efi`:**

        - Type `n` and press `Enter`.
        - Choose `p` for primary partition.
        - Partition number: `2`.
        - First sector: Press `Enter` to accept the default.
        - Last sector: Type `+600M` and press `Enter`.

      - **Change Partition Type to EFI System:**

        - Type `t` and press `Enter`.
        - Partition number: `2`.
        - Hex code: Type `ef` or `1` (depending on `fdisk` version) and press `Enter`.

      - **Create Partition for `/boot`:**

        - Type `n` and press `Enter`.
        - Choose `p` for primary partition.
        - Partition number: `3`.
        - First sector: Press `Enter` to accept the default.
        - Last sector: Type `+1G` and press `Enter`.

      - **Verify the Partition Table:**

        - Type `p` and press `Enter` to review the changes.

      - **Write Changes to Disk:**

        - Type `w` and press `Enter`.

6. **Reboot the System:**

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   - Necessary for the kernel to recognize the new partition layout.

---

#### **Step 3: Format the New Partitions**

After rebooting:

1. **Format `/dev/sda2` as EFI System Partition (FAT32):**

   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda2
   ```

2. **Format `/dev/sda3` as ext4 for `/boot`:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
   ```

---

#### **Step 4: Mount the New Partitions Temporarily**

1. **Create Mount Points:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/new_boot
   sudo mkdir /mnt/new_boot/efi
   ```

2. **Mount `/dev/sda3` to `/mnt/new_boot`:**

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/new_boot
   ```

3. **Mount `/dev/sda2` to `/mnt/new_boot/efi`:**

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/new_boot/efi
   ```

---

#### **Step 5: Copy Existing Boot Files**

1. **Copy `/boot` Contents to the New `/boot` Partition:**

   ```bash
   sudo rsync -a --progress /boot/ /mnt/new_boot/
   ```

2. **Verify the Files Were Copied:**

   ```bash
   ls /mnt/new_boot
   ```

   - You should see the same files as in `/boot`.

---

#### **Step 6: Update `/etc/fstab`**

1. **Backup the Original `/etc/fstab`:**

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
   ```

2. **Get UUIDs of the New Partitions:**

   ```bash
   sudo blkid /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3
   ```

   - Note the UUIDs for `/dev/sda2` and `/dev/sda3`.

3. **Edit `/etc/fstab`:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   - Comment out the existing lines for `/boot` and `/boot/efi` by adding a `#` at the beginning.
   - Add the following lines, replacing `UUID_sda3` and `UUID_sda2` with the actual UUIDs:

     ```
     UUID=UUID_sda3   /boot      ext4    defaults        0 2
     UUID=UUID_sda2   /boot/efi  vfat    umask=0077      0 2
     ```

4. **Save and Exit:**

   - In Nano, press `Ctrl+O` to save, `Enter` to confirm, and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

---

#### **Step 7: Update the Bootloader**

1. **Mount the New `/boot` and `/boot/efi` Partitions:**

   ```bash
   sudo mount /boot
   sudo mount /boot/efi
   ```

2. **Reinstall GRUB to `/dev/sda`:**

   ```bash
   sudo grub2-install /dev/sda
   ```

3. **Regenerate GRUB Configuration:**

   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

   - For UEFI systems, use:

     ```bash
     sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/almalinux/grub.cfg
     ```

---

#### **Step 8: Unmount Old Boot Partitions**

1. **Unmount the Old `/boot` and `/boot/efi` (if still mounted):**

   ```bash
   sudo umount /dev/sdc2
   sudo umount /dev/sdc1
   ```

---

#### **Step 9: Reboot and Verify**

1. **Reboot the System:**

---

### **Additional Details and Explanations**

#### **Why We Shrink the Root Logical Volume and Physical Volume**

- **Logical Volume (`/dev/almalinux_omniversal-root`)**: We need to reduce its size to free up space in the physical volume.
- **Physical Volume (`/dev/sda1`)**: Shrinking it allows us to reduce the size of the partition (`/dev/sda1`), creating unallocated space for new partitions.

#### **Commands Explanation**

- **`e2fsck -f`**: Forces a filesystem check to ensure integrity before resizing.
- **`resize2fs`**: Resizes the filesystem to a smaller size.
- **`lvreduce`**: Reduces the size of a logical volume.
- **`pvresize`**: Adjusts the size of a physical volume.
- **`fdisk`**: A disk partitioning tool used to modify partition tables.
- **`mkfs.vfat` and `mkfs.ext4`**: Create new filesystems on partitions.
- **`rsync`**: Copies files while preserving permissions and attributes.
- **`grub2-install`**: Installs the GRUB bootloader to a specified disk.
- **`grub2-mkconfig`**: Generates a new GRUB configuration file.
- **`df -h`**: Displays disk space usage in human-readable format.

#### **Safety Precautions**

- **Backups**: Always back up important data before modifying partitions or filesystems.
- **Careful Input**: Double-check commands before execution to avoid mistakes.
- **System State**: Ensure the system is not under heavy load and that no critical processes are running.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

- **System Fails to Boot**:

  - Boot from a live USB/DVD to troubleshoot.
  - Check the `/etc/fstab` file for correct UUIDs.
  - Verify that GRUB is correctly installed and configured.

- **Partitions Not Recognized**:

  - Use `sudo partprobe` to inform the kernel of partition table changes.
  - Reboot the system if necessary.

- **Permission Issues**:

  - Ensure correct ownership and permissions of `/boot` directories.

---

### **Conclusion**

By carefully following these steps, you've moved your boot partitions to the SSD, eliminating reliance on the USB drive for booting. This enhances system reliability and performance.

2. **Operations**

   - The interface is similar to GParted.
   - Supports creating, resizing, moving, and deleting partitions.

---

## **Performing Your Specific Tasks with GParted**

Now, let's tailor the steps to help you move your `/boot` and `/boot/efi` partitions from the USB drive to your SSD using GParted.

### **Step 1: Backup Your Data**

- Before making any changes, back up all important data to an external drive.

### **Step 2: Shrink the Root Partition on the SSD (`/dev/sda`)**

1. **Open GParted**

   ```bash
   sudo gparted
   ```

2. **Select SSD (`/dev/sda`)**

   - Use the drop-down menu at the top-right to select `/dev/sda`.

3. **Resize the LVM Partition (`/dev/sda1`)**

   - Right-click on `/dev/sda1` and select **Resize/Move**.
   - Reduce the size to free up at least 2 GB of unallocated space at the **end** of the disk.
   - **Note**: You cannot resize an LVM physical volume directly in GParted. You'll need to:

     - First, reduce the size of the logical volume and filesystem within the LVM.

     **Alternative**:

     - Since resizing LVM partitions graphically is complex, consider using the graphical tool **system-config-lvm**.

### **Step 3: Use system-config-lvm**

#### **Installing system-config-lvm**

```bash
sudo dnf install system-config-lvm -y
```

#### **Using system-config-lvm**

1. **Launch the Application**

   ```bash
   sudo system-config-lvm
   ```

2. **Navigate the Interface**

   - **Physical View**: Shows physical volumes.
   - **Volume Groups**: Shows volume groups like `almalinux_omniversal`.
   - **Logical Volumes**: Shows logical volumes like `root`, `home`, `swap`.

3. **Shrink the Root Logical Volume**

   - Select the `root` logical volume.
   - Choose **Edit Properties**.
   - Reduce the size to free up space (e.g., reduce by 2 GB).
   - Apply changes.

4. **Shrink the Physical Volume**

   - After reducing the logical volume, you can reduce the physical volume.
   - Unfortunately, **system-config-lvm** may not support shrinking PVs graphically.

   - **Alternative**: Proceed to GParted to handle the freed-up space.

### **Step 4: Create New Partitions for `/boot` and `/boot/efi`**

1. **Return to GParted**

   - After freeing up space, refresh GParted.

2. **Create Unallocated Space**

   - If unallocated space is now visible after `/dev/sda1`, proceed.

3. **Create `/boot` Partition**

   - Right-click on the unallocated space.
   - Select **New**.
   - Set the size to **1 GB**.
   - Choose **ext4** as the file system.
   - Label it as `boot`.
   - Click **Add**.

4. **Create `/boot/efi` Partition**

   - Right-click on the remaining unallocated space.
   - Select **New**.
   - Set the size to **600 MB**.
   - Choose **fat32** as the file system.
   - Set the partition type to **EFI System Partition**:
     - After creating the partition, right-click it, select **Manage Flags**, and check **boot** and **esp**.
   - Label it as `EFI`.
   - Click **Add**.

5. **Apply Changes**

   - Click the **Apply All Operations** button (green checkmark).
   - Confirm to execute the operations.

### **Step 5: Copy Boot Files**

Since moving system partitions is complex, it's safer to perform these steps from a live environment to ensure files are not in use.

1. **Boot from an AlmaLinux Live USB/DVD**

   - Download the AlmaLinux ISO and create a bootable USB if you haven't already.

2. **Launch GParted in Live Environment**

   - Open GParted to verify your partitions.

3. **Mount Partitions**

   - **Mount the Old `/boot` Partition** (on the USB drive):

     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/old_boot
     sudo mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt/old_boot
     ```

   - **Mount the New `/boot` Partition**:

     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/new_boot
     sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/new_boot
     ```

4. **Copy Files**

   - Use `rsync` to copy files:

     ```bash
     sudo rsync -aHAX --progress /mnt/old_boot/ /mnt/new_boot/
     ```

5. **Repeat for `/boot/efi`** (if applicable)

   - **Mount the Old `/boot/efi` Partition**:

     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/old_efi
     sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/old_efi
     ```

   - **Mount the New `/boot/efi` Partition**:

     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/new_efi
     sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/new_efi
     ```

   - **Copy Files**:

     ```bash
     sudo rsync -aHAX --progress /mnt/old_efi/ /mnt/new_efi/
     ```

### **Step 6: Update fstab and Reinstall GRUB**

1. **Chroot into Your System**

   - **Mount the Root Partition**:

     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/sysroot
     sudo mount /dev/almalinux_omniversal/root /mnt/sysroot
     ```

   - **Mount Essential Filesystems**:

     ```bash
     sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/sysroot/dev
     sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/sysroot/proc
     sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sysroot/sys
     ```

   - **Mount the New `/boot` and `/boot/efi`**:

     ```bash
     sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sysroot/boot
     sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sysroot/boot/efi
     ```

   - **Chroot**:

     ```bash
     sudo chroot /mnt/sysroot
     ```

2. **Update `/etc/fstab`**

   - **Backup fstab**:

     ```bash
     cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
     ```

   - **Edit fstab**:

     ```bash
     nano /etc/fstab
     ```

     - Update the entries for `/boot` and `/boot/efi` to reflect the new UUIDs.
     - Use `blkid` to find the UUIDs:

       ```bash
       blkid /dev/sda2
       blkid /dev/sda3
       ```

     - Replace the old UUIDs with the new ones in `/etc/fstab`.

3. **Reinstall GRUB**

   - For BIOS systems:

     ```bash
     grub2-install /dev/sda
     ```

   - For UEFI systems:

     ```bash
     grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=almalinux --recheck
     ```

   - **Generate GRUB Configuration**:

     ```bash
     grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
     ```

     - For UEFI:

       ```bash
       grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/almalinux/grub.cfg
       ```

4. **Exit Chroot and Reboot**

   - **Exit Chroot**:

     ```bash
     exit
     ```

   - **Unmount Filesystems**:

     ```bash
     sudo umount /mnt/sysroot/dev
     sudo umount /mnt/sysroot/proc
     sudo umount /mnt/sysroot/sys
     sudo umount /mnt/sysroot/boot/efi
     sudo umount /mnt/sysroot/boot
     sudo umount /mnt/sysroot
     ```

   - **Reboot**:

     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

### **Step 7: Verify and Remove Old Partitions**

1. **Verify Boot**

   - Ensure the system boots correctly.
   - Check that `/boot` and `/boot/efi` are mounted from `/dev/sda2` and `/dev/sda3`.

     ```bash
     df -h | grep boot
     ```

2. **Remove Old Boot Partitions (Optional)**

   - Once you're certain everything is working, you can repurpose the old partitions on the USB drive.
