# Undo drive mount issues

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Is there any way to undo everything I did with the mounting of another drive? I can't access any of the drupal work I did nor nextcloud nor any of my hard work you helped me do!

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: It sounds like the mounting of a drive might have overwritten or disrupted access to your previous filesystem configuration. Don't worry! Here’s a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and undo the changes:

---

### Step 1: **Check the Current Mounts**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command to see your current mounted drives:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   This will display all the drives and their mount points. Take note of the new drive you mounted and where it is mounted (e.g., `/mnt/newdrive`).

3. Also, check the `/etc/fstab` file to see if any changes were made there:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/fstab
   ```

---

### Step 2: **Unmount the New Drive**
If the new drive is interfering with access to the original data:
1. Unmount the new drive:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /path/to/mountpoint
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/mountpoint` with the actual directory (e.g., `/mnt/newdrive`).

2. If the drive was auto-mounted during boot via `/etc/fstab`, temporarily comment it out by editing the file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```
   Add a `#` before the line referencing the new drive. Save and exit.

3. Reboot your system to see if the original data becomes accessible.

---

### Step 3: **Check for Data in the Original Mount Point**
Sometimes, mounting a new drive over an existing folder hides the original data. To check:
1. Identify the original mount point (e.g., `/var/www/html` or `/mnt`).
2. Temporarily move the current mount:
   ```bash
   sudo mv /path/to/mountpoint /path/to/mountpoint.bak
   ```
3. Check if your original files are still present:
   ```bash
   ls /path/to/original/files
   ```

---

### Step 4: **Restore Access to Original Data**
If the above steps restore access:
1. Remove or remount the interfering drive in a separate directory (e.g., `/mnt/newdrive`).
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/newdrive
   sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/newdrive
   ```
   Replace `/dev/sdX1` with the new drive’s identifier from `lsblk`.

2. If necessary, copy back the original data or restore its permissions.

---

### Step 5: **Recover Lost Data (if needed)**
If data appears missing or corrupted:
1. Check for backups (e.g., the Dropbox sync you set up).
2. Look for snapshots or undeleted data on the original drive:
   ```bash
   sudo fsck /dev/sdX1
   ```
3. Use recovery tools like `testdisk` if the filesystem appears damaged.

---

### Additional Support
If these steps don’t resolve your issue, share:
- The output of `lsblk` and `df -h`.
- A copy of your `/etc/fstab`.
- Specific mount points you used before and after.

This will help diagnose the exact problem and guide you further. Don’t worry, we’ll get everything back on track!
