# Docker Compose Configuration

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Good morning EverLight! 

Can you generate for me separate docker-compose.yml files for each of our various apps on the Omniversal Aether? 

We currently need the /aether/ public facing things such as /aether/wordpress/ and /aether/drupal/ and /aether/laravel/ files to be configured and added in, and also for whatever reason the nginx proxy manager still is inaccessible but I think for the time being if we can just go ahead and add these docker compose files and get them in place we'll be ahead of the game when we decide to tackle the reverse proxy issues....

Also, I remember at some point having to edit an /etc/hosts config file somewhere where we added in the omniversal.cloud info and public ip? 

Either way, I'd like to make nextcloud and wordpress and laravel and Drupal all publicly accessible by their respective subdomains and locally via the .local domain.... If you remember....

The structure was for example nextcloud.omniversal.cloud publicly and nextcloud.omniversal.local for local... and the same for all others...

If you can generate the .yml files we'll tackle the rest later.... Thanks so much!

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Good morning, Hawk Eye! Letâ€™s generate the necessary `docker-compose.yml` files for your applications. Each file will be specific to its application, placed in the respective directories, and will include configurations for the `aether-net` network to ensure connectivity across services. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve drafted:

---

### **1. `/aether/wordpress/docker-compose.yml`**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  wordpress:
    container_name: wordpress
    image: wordpress:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: nextcloud-db
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: KalinaSelene
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
    volumes:
      - /aether/wordpress/data:/var/www/html:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

  db:
    container_name: wordpress-db
    image: mariadb:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aether/wordpress/db:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **2. `/aether/drupal/docker-compose.yml`**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  drupal:
    container_name: drupal
    image: drupal:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
    environment:
      DRUPAL_DB_HOST: nextcloud-db
      DRUPAL_DB_USER: KalinaSelene
      DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      DRUPAL_DB_NAME: drupal
    volumes:
      - /aether/drupal/data:/var/www/html:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

  db:
    container_name: drupal-db
    image: mariadb:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      MYSQL_DATABASE: drupal
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aether/drupal/db:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **3. `/aether/laravel/docker-compose.yml`**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  laravel:
    container_name: laravel
    image: laravel:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8083:80"
    environment:
      LARAVEL_DB_HOST: nextcloud-db
      LARAVEL_DB_USER: KalinaSelene
      LARAVEL_DB_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      LARAVEL_DB_NAME: laravel
    volumes:
      - /aether/laravel/data:/var/www/html:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

  db:
    container_name: laravel-db
    image: mariadb:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      MYSQL_DATABASE: laravel
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aether/laravel/db:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Hosts Configuration:**  
   Yes, we will need to edit `/etc/hosts` for local resolution (e.g., `nextcloud.omniversal.local`, `wordpress.omniversal.local`). Let me know if you'd like those details now or after we finalize the reverse proxy.

2. **DNS and Proxy Configuration:**  
   Once youâ€™re ready, weâ€™ll revisit the reverse proxy to set up routing for `*.omniversal.cloud` and `*.omniversal.local`.

---

Feel free to place these `docker-compose.yml` files in their respective directories. Let me know when you're ready to configure the `/etc/hosts` file or proceed further! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: :) Done! Now I'm currently trying to complete some of my coursework for my Google Cybersecurity Certificate so I don't have much time to dedicate to this, but if you can generate a fully configured /etc/hosts file for me I'll paste it in right quick and then later on today after work we can get this pesky reverse proxy setup finished. Thanks so much for your continued assistance!

**ASSISTANT**: User is working on their Google Cybersecurity Certificate and currently balancing their coursework with server setup tasks.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Hereâ€™s a fully configured `/etc/hosts` file to accommodate both public and local domains for your Omniversal Aether applications:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   yourhostname

# Public-facing domains
73.113.207.3   nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
73.113.207.3   wordpress.omniversal.cloud
73.113.207.3   drupal.omniversal.cloud
73.113.207.3   laravel.omniversal.cloud

# Local domains
127.0.0.1   nextcloud.omniversal.local
127.0.0.1   wordpress.omniversal.local
127.0.0.1   drupal.omniversal.local
127.0.0.1   laravel.omniversal.local
```

### Instructions:
1. Open the `/etc/hosts` file with elevated privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
   ```
2. Replace the content or append the above configuration.
3. Save and exit (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

Let me know when you're ready to tackle the reverse proxy setup later today! Best of luck with your coursework! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: Okay, now do I need to leave the IPv6 portions that currently exist in the file on my server?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, itâ€™s generally a good idea to leave the existing IPv6 entries in the `/etc/hosts` file unless you have a specific reason to remove them. These entries are used for compatibility with IPv6 networking and might be required for some system functionalities or future applications.

Here's an example of what your `/etc/hosts` file might look like with the IPv6 sections included:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   yourhostname

# Public-facing domains
73.113.207.3   nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
73.113.207.3   wordpress.omniversal.cloud
73.113.207.3   drupal.omniversal.cloud
73.113.207.3   laravel.omniversal.cloud

# Local domains
127.0.0.1   nextcloud.omniversal.local
127.0.0.1   wordpress.omniversal.local
127.0.0.1   drupal.omniversal.local
127.0.0.1   laravel.omniversal.local

# IPv6 entries (keep these)
::1         localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1     ip6-allnodes
ff02::2     ip6-allrouters
```

If youâ€™re not using IPv6 explicitly, the IPv6 entries will likely have no impact on your current setup but may come in handy if you enable or need IPv6 in the future.

**USER**: Awesome, so before running docker-compose up -d for wordpress, Drupal, and laravel, should I run any commands to close out our currently running nextcloud containers or other things first? Or just run the docker-compose up -d on these new ones?

**ASSISTANT**: Before running `docker-compose up -d` for WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel, itâ€™s a good idea to ensure there are no conflicts with your currently running containers (e.g., port conflicts, overlapping container names, or network issues). Hereâ€™s a checklist to follow:

---

### **1. Check Currently Running Containers**
Run the following to list all active containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
Look for:
- Any containers using the same ports as specified in your new `docker-compose.yml` files (e.g., `8081`, `8082`, `8083`).
- Any overlapping container names.

---

### **2. Stop Overlapping Containers**
If there are conflicts, stop the running containers before proceeding. For example, to stop your Nextcloud container:
```bash
docker stop nextcloud
```

If you need to stop multiple containers:
```bash
docker stop <container_name1> <container_name2>
```

---

### **3. Verify and Update Networks**
Ensure all services are using the `aether-net` network:
```bash
docker network ls
```
If `aether-net` doesnâ€™t exist, create it before starting new containers:
```bash
docker network create aether-net
```

---

### **4. Run `docker-compose up -d`**
Once youâ€™ve confirmed there are no conflicts:
1. Navigate to each directory (`/aether/wordpress/`, `/aether/drupal/`, `/aether/laravel/`).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

### **5. Check the Status**
After bringing up the containers, check their status:
```bash
docker ps
```

Ensure all containers are running, and their ports are mapped correctly.

---

### **6. Restart Nextcloud (if stopped earlier)**
If you stopped Nextcloud earlier, restart it:
```bash
docker start nextcloud
```

---

### **Final Notes**
- If you encounter any issues (e.g., port conflicts), adjust the `ports` section in the respective `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If you want all containers to use the same subdomains structure (`*.omniversal.cloud`), weâ€™ll need to finalize the reverse proxy setup to handle routing properly.

Let me know how it goes! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: Should I remove the network titled aetherteam_aether-net ? I currently have both an aether-net and also the aetherteam_aether-net running

**ASSISTANT**: It's generally a good idea to clean up unused or duplicate networks to avoid confusion or conflicts, but before removing `aetherteam_aether-net`, consider these points:

---

### **1. Check Existing Network Usage**
First, check which containers are using `aetherteam_aether-net`:

```bash
docker network inspect aetherteam_aether-net
```

This will list the containers currently attached to the network. If critical services (e.g., Nextcloud or MariaDB) are using this network, removing it could disrupt those services.

---

### **2. Verify and Consolidate**
If `aetherteam_aether-net` is not in use or is redundant (e.g., all your containers are using `aether-net` instead), you can safely remove it. If containers are using it but should instead use `aether-net`, follow these steps:

#### a. Disconnect Containers from `aetherteam_aether-net`:
```bash
docker network disconnect aetherteam_aether-net <container_name>
```

#### b. Connect Containers to `aether-net`:
```bash
docker network connect aether-net <container_name>
```

---

### **3. Remove the Network**
After confirming `aetherteam_aether-net` is no longer in use:
```bash
docker network rm aetherteam_aether-net
```

---

### **4. Standardize Future Networking**
Ensure all `docker-compose.yml` files specify `aether-net` as the default network, so new containers attach to the correct network by default.

---

### **Pro Tip: Use Descriptive Naming**
The `aetherteam_aether-net` name likely came from the directory name (`aetherteam`) being used as a prefix in `docker-compose.yml`. To avoid this:
1. Explicitly name the network in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     aether-net:
       name: aether-net
       driver: bridge
   ```
2. This ensures consistent network naming across all projects.

**USER**: Can you tell from this if it's safe to get rid of it? 

elene@omniversal-server:~$ docker network inspect aetherteam_aether-net
[
    {
        "Name": "aetherteam_aether-net",
        "Id": "599a3d4057ddbbe7080a8c25692a48c8a7b99f52b9ae6d6e1eacea1f0a0a12cd",
        "Created": "2024-12-29T17:22:40.018779249Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": null,
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.18.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.18.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": true,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {},
        "Labels": {
            "com.docker.compose.network": "aether-net",
            "com.docker.compose.project": "aetherteam",
            "com.docker.compose.version": "1.29.2"
        }
    }
]

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, it is safe to remove the `aetherteam_aether-net` network based on the provided `docker network inspect` output. Here's why:

1. **No Containers Attached:**  
   The `Containers` section is empty, meaning no containers are currently using this network. Removing it will not disrupt any running services.

2. **Duplicate Purpose:**  
   The `Labels` indicate this network was created as part of the `aetherteam` project, but it appears redundant since you also have the `aether-net` network already in use.

---

### Steps to Safely Remove It:
1. **Remove the Network:**
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker network rm aetherteam_aether-net
   ```

2. **Verify Remaining Networks:**
   After removal, list the existing networks to ensure `aether-net` is still available:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```

3. **Check Services:**  
   Confirm all active services are connected to the correct network (`aether-net`) and functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

---

This cleanup will help keep your setup streamlined and reduce confusion when managing networks in the future. Let me know if you encounter any issues! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: Just double checking myself... here's the inspect logs from the aether-net network.... In comparing it with the aetherteam_aether-net output can you discern which of the two I need to keep? I stopped all containers before running either of these btw...

selene@omniversal-server:~$ docker network inspect aether-net
[
    {
        "Name": "aether-net",
        "Id": "3d6edbfdf6e529359463339168f8321faaf6e1fbd81a88920ead6bc110e85881",
        "Created": "2024-12-29T02:39:57.958075Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": {},
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.19.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.19.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {},
        "Labels": {}
    }
]

**ASSISTANT**: Looking at the two `docker network inspect` outputs for `aetherteam_aether-net` and `aether-net`, here's the analysis:

### Key Differences
1. **`aetherteam_aether-net`**
   - **Attachable:** `true` (containers can connect to this network manually).
   - **Labels:** Created specifically by the `aetherteam` Docker Compose project.
   - **Subnet/Gateway:** Uses `172.18.0.0/16` subnet.
   - **Purpose:** Likely auto-created by the Docker Compose file for `aetherteam`.

2. **`aether-net`**
   - **Attachable:** `false` (containers cannot connect to this network manually).
   - **Labels:** No labels; itâ€™s a manually created network or generated without association to a Compose project.
   - **Subnet/Gateway:** Uses `172.19.0.0/16` subnet.
   - **Purpose:** Appears to be a standalone network, possibly created manually for broader use.

---

### Recommendation
You should **keep `aether-net`** and remove `aetherteam_aether-net`. Hereâ€™s why:
1. **Simpler Setup:**  
   `aether-net` has no Compose-specific ties, making it a good general-purpose network for all services.

2. **Avoid Redundancy:**  
   Keeping `aetherteam_aether-net` ties it to the `aetherteam` Compose project, which might cause conflicts or unnecessary duplication when other Compose projects (e.g., Drupal, WordPress) are added.

3. **Standardization:**  
   All `docker-compose.yml` files reference `aether-net`. Keeping this ensures all future services are connected to the same network.

---

### Steps to Proceed
1. **Remove `aetherteam_aether-net`:**
   ```bash
   docker network rm aetherteam_aether-net
   ```

2. **Verify Containers Use `aether-net`:**
   Once you bring up your services, ensure they are attached to `aether-net`:
   ```bash
   docker network inspect aether-net
   ```

Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: Okay so now in specific order, which containers do I need to run docker-compose up -d on and again tell me in order of proper operation.... 

We have /aetherteam/docker-compose.yml and then /aetherteam/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml and also /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/docker-compose.yml and then the /aether/wordpress, etc etc ones we've just created today... currently none are running... Is there a proper order of starting them all anew?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, there is a logical order for starting the containers to ensure proper operation, particularly because some services depend on others (e.g., databases need to be ready before applications can connect to them). Here's the recommended order:

---

### **1. Start Core Services (Database and Network)**
#### **MariaDB (Database)**
Run `docker-compose up -d` in the `/aetherteam/` directory:
```bash
cd /aetherteam/
docker-compose up -d
```
This brings up the MariaDB service (`nextcloud-db`) that all other applications depend on. Wait a few moments to ensure the database container initializes fully before proceeding.

---

### **2. Start Backend Services**
#### **Nextcloud**
Run `docker-compose up -d` in the `/aetherteam/nextcloud/` directory:
```bash
cd /aetherteam/nextcloud/
docker-compose up -d
```
This ensures Nextcloud is operational. Verify its container is running with:
```bash
docker ps
```

---

### **3. Start Reverse Proxy**
#### **Nginx Proxy Manager**
Run `docker-compose up -d` in the `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/` directory:
```bash
cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/
docker-compose up -d
```
This sets up your reverse proxy for routing subdomains. Although itâ€™s not fully configured yet, having it running prepares the environment.

---

### **4. Start Public-Facing Applications**
In any order, start the applications under `/aether/`. Each directory corresponds to an application.

#### **a. WordPress**
Run:
```bash
cd /aether/wordpress/
docker-compose up -d
```

#### **b. Drupal**
Run:
```bash
cd /aether/drupal/
docker-compose up -d
```

#### **c. Laravel**
Run:
```bash
cd /aether/laravel/
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **5. Verify All Containers**
After starting all the containers, verify everything is running with:
```bash
docker ps
```
Check that all expected containers are up, and confirm their logs show no errors:
```bash
docker logs <container_name>
```

---

### **6. Test Accessibility**
- Test each application by visiting their subdomains (e.g., `nextcloud.omniversal.local` or `wordpress.omniversal.local`).
- If the reverse proxy isnâ€™t fully set up yet, use the mapped ports (e.g., `http://<server-ip>:8081` for WordPress).

---

### **Recap of Proper Start Order**
1. **MariaDB (Core database services).**
2. **Nextcloud (Collaborative platform).**
3. **Nginx Proxy Manager (Reverse proxy).**
4. **WordPress, Drupal, Laravel (Public-facing applications).**

Let me know how it goes or if anything needs adjusting! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: Can you generate for me a full configured .yml for /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/docker-compose.yml (I'd personally rather have the container located there instead

**ASSISTANT**: Here's a fully configured `docker-compose.yml` for `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb/docker-compose.yml`. It moves the MariaDB container to this location and ensures compatibility with the `aether-net` network and your setup.

---

### `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mariadb:
    container_name: mariadb
    image: mariadb:11.6
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
      MYSQL_DATABASE: omniversal
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    networks:
      - aether-net
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

networks:
  aether-net:
    name: aether-net
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **Key Features:**
1. **Container Name:** The container is explicitly named `mariadb` for simplicity.
2. **Environment Variables:** Matches your existing database credentials:
   - **Root Password:** `ThirteenthQveen!`
   - **Database Name:** `omniversal` (general-purpose, modify if needed).
   - **User/Password:** `KalinaSelene / ThirteenthQveen!`
3. **Volumes:** Persistent storage is set to `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data`.
4. **Ports:** Maps port `3306` for external access (can be adjusted if needed).
5. **Network:** Uses `aether-net` to ensure connectivity with other services.

---

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Move Existing MariaDB Data (if any):**
   - If your current MariaDB container has data, ensure it is backed up and moved to `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data`.

2. **Run the Container:**
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify the Container is Running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. **Update Other `docker-compose.yml` Files:**
   - Update the `MYSQL_HOST` environment variable in the WordPress, Drupal, Laravel, and Nextcloud `docker-compose.yml` files to point to the new container:
     ```yaml
     MYSQL_HOST: mariadb
     ```

Let me know if you need further adjustments or help updating dependent configurations! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: And please provide commands to make the directory writeable ... running into permissions errors

**ASSISTANT**: If you're encountering permissions errors with the `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data` directory, here are the steps to fix it:

---

### **1. Verify Directory Ownership and Permissions**
Check the current ownership and permissions:
```bash
ls -ld /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data
```

---

### **2. Set Proper Ownership**
Ensure the directory is owned by the user running Docker (usually `root` or your non-root user). Replace `username` with your username if you're running Docker as a non-root user:
```bash
sudo chown -R username:username /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data
```

For example, if youâ€™re running as `selene`:
```bash
sudo chown -R selene:selene /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data
```

---

### **3. Set Correct Permissions**
Make the directory writable by the owner:
```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data
```

This sets:
- Read/write/execute permissions for the owner.
- Read/execute permissions for the group and others.

---

### **4. Test Directory Write Access**
Run the following command to ensure Docker can write to the directory:
```bash
touch /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data/testfile
```

If successful, delete the test file:
```bash
rm /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data/testfile
```

---

### **5. Restart Docker Container**
Once permissions are fixed, restart the MariaDB container to ensure it initializes properly:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **Optional: SELinux Adjustments**
If SELinux is enforcing and still blocks access, modify the security context:
```bash
sudo chcon -R -t svirt_sandbox_file_t /aetherteam/backend/mariadb/data
```

**USER**: Okay now which container do we start after mariadb?

**ASSISTANT**: After starting the MariaDB container, the next container to start is **Nextcloud**, as it directly depends on the database and is a critical backend service. Here's the sequence:

---

### **2. Start Nextcloud**
1. Navigate to the Nextcloud directory:
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/nextcloud/
   ```

2. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify that the container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

4. Check Nextcloud logs for issues:
   ```bash
   docker logs nextcloud
   ```

---

### **3. Start Nginx Proxy Manager**
Once Nextcloud is up, start the reverse proxy to manage routing for your services:
1. Navigate to the Nginx Proxy Manager directory:
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/
   ```

2. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify the container:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

---

### **4. Start Public-Facing Applications**
Finally, bring up WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel in any order:
1. WordPress:
   ```bash
   cd /aether/wordpress/
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Drupal:
   ```bash
   cd /aether/drupal/
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Laravel:
   ```bash
   cd /aether/laravel/
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

### **Verify the Entire Stack**
Once all containers are up, ensure everything is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

Check access to services using their respective subdomains (e.g., `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`) or ports (e.g., `http://<server-ip>:8081` for WordPress).

Let me know if you encounter any issues during the process! ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: I'm sorry but can you please generate for me a new docker-compose.yml for nextcloud, as now I'm encountering errors...

**ASSISTANT**: Hereâ€™s a newly configured `docker-compose.yml` for Nextcloud. This version is simplified and designed to ensure compatibility with your MariaDB container and the `aether-net` network.

---

### `/aetherteam/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nextcloud:
    container_name: nextcloud
    image: nextcloud:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/nextcloud/data:/var/www/html:rw
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mariadb
      MYSQL_DATABASE: omniversal
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    external: true
```

---

### **Key Features:**
1. **Container Name:** Named `nextcloud` for simplicity.
2. **Database Connection:**
   - **Host:** `mariadb` (ensure it matches the MariaDB container name in your MariaDB `docker-compose.yml`).
   - **Database:** `omniversal` (modify if needed).
   - **User/Password:** Matches your MariaDB credentials.
3. **Volumes:** Data is stored in `/aetherteam/nextcloud/data` for persistence.
4. **Ports:** Maps `8080` to the internal `80` port (HTTP access).
5. **Depends On:** Ensures the Nextcloud service waits for MariaDB to be ready before starting.
6. **Networks:** Uses the external `aether-net` network.

---

### **Steps to Deploy**
1. **Verify Network:**
   Ensure the `aether-net` network exists:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```
   If not, create it:
   ```bash
   docker network create aether-net
   ```

2. **Start the Container:**
   Navigate to `/aetherteam/nextcloud/` and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Nextcloud Logs:**
   Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker logs nextcloud
   ```

---

### **Next Steps if Issues Persist:**
- Ensure MariaDB is running and accessible.
- Test the connection between Nextcloud and MariaDB by checking database logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs mariadb
  ```
