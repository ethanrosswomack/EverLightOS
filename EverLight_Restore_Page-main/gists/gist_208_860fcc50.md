## Jailbreaking an iPad: Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Device Requirements**: Ensure your iPad model and iOS version are compatible with the jailbreak tool you intend to use. Common tools are:
   - **Checkra1n**: For devices on iOS 12 – iOS 14, compatible with many older iPads.
   - **unc0ver**: For iOS 11 – iOS 14.3, with support for newer devices.
   - **Taurine**: For iOS 14 – iOS 14.3.
   
2. **Backup**: Create a full backup using iCloud or iTunes/Finder to prevent data loss if anything goes wrong.

3. **Disable Passcode & Face/Touch ID**: Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode** and temporarily disable your passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID.

4. **Turn Off Find My iPad**: Go to **Settings > [Your Name] > Find My > Find My iPad** and toggle it off.

5. **Download Required Software**:
   - **Checkra1n**: Available for macOS and Linux (not Windows).
   - **unc0ver** and **Taurine**: Can be installed using AltStore or sideloaded with Cydia Impactor or other sideloading apps.

---

### Jailbreak Process

#### Using Checkra1n (macOS/Linux Only)

1. **Download Checkra1n**:
   - Go to the [official Checkra1n website](https://checkra.in/) and download the latest version.

2. **Install Checkra1n**:
   - **macOS**: Open the .dmg file, drag Checkra1n to the Applications folder.
   - **Linux**: Install dependencies if needed, and open the app from Terminal using `sudo checkra1n`.

3. **Connect Your iPad** to your computer using a USB cable.

4. **Open Checkra1n** and select "Start."

5. **Enter DFU Mode**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions in Checkra1n to put your iPad into DFU mode (Device Firmware Update). Each model has slightly different steps; the Checkra1n interface will guide you.

6. **Run the Jailbreak**:
   - Once in DFU mode, Checkra1n will automatically begin the jailbreaking process. Let it complete without interrupting.

7. **Install Cydia**:
   - After the jailbreak completes, you’ll see a Checkra1n app on your iPad’s home screen. Open it, then select **Cydia** to install the jailbreak app store.

#### Using unc0ver or Taurine

1. **Install AltStore on Your Computer**:
   - Go to the [AltStore website](https://altstore.io/) and download AltStore for macOS or Windows.

2. **Install AltStore on Your iPad**:
   - Connect your iPad to your computer.
   - Open AltStore and install it on your iPad. This may require entering your Apple ID credentials.

3. **Download the Jailbreak Tool**:
   - Download the latest **unc0ver** or **Taurine** .ipa file from their respective official websites ([unc0ver.dev](https://unc0ver.dev) or [taurine.app](https://taurine.app)).

4. **Install the .ipa File Using AltStore**:
   - Open AltStore on your iPad.
   - Use AltStore to install the **unc0ver** or **Taurine** .ipa file.

5. **Run the Jailbreak Tool**:
   - Open the unc0ver or Taurine app on your iPad.
   - Tap **Jailbreak** or **Install** and wait for the jailbreak process to complete. The device will likely restart.

6. **Confirm Cydia or Sileo Installation**:
   - After the jailbreak, you should see **Cydia** (with unc0ver) or **Sileo** (with Taurine) installed on your home screen.

---

### Post-Jailbreak Steps

1. **Re-enable Passcode and Face/Touch ID**: Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode** to set these up again if desired.

2. **Re-enable Find My iPad**: Go to **Settings > [Your Name] > Find My > Find My iPad** and turn it back on.

3. **Install Essential Tweaks and Utilities**:
   - Open Cydia or Sileo and browse for popular tweaks, themes, and utility apps.
   - Recommended tweaks include **Filza** (file manager), **AppSync Unified** (for sideloading apps), and **iCleaner** (for system cleanup).

---

### Troubleshooting

- **If the device gets stuck in a boot loop**: Try entering **DFU mode** and running the jailbreak again through Checkra1n or perform a forced restart.
- **If apps or tweaks are not functioning**: Check for compatibility issues with your iOS version and jailbreak tool.
- **Re-jailbreaking after a restart**: Some jailbreaks are semi-untethered, meaning you’ll need to open the jailbreak app and re-run the process after each reboot.

---

### Important Notes

- **Stay Updated**: Jailbreaking often requires updates as Apple releases new iOS versions. Follow the jailbreak tool developers on social media for updates.
- **Use Reputable Sources**: Only download tools and tweaks from trusted sources to avoid malware.
- **Avoid Updating iOS**: Future updates may patch the jailbreak, requiring you to wait for a new jailbreak tool compatible with the latest version.

**USER**: Great thanks - I’ll also need to know how to deactivate the Remote Management System for it to be able to begin doing any of this. Can you help with that too?

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly, here’s a guide on bypassing or deactivating the Remote Management (MDM) System on an iPad. Remote Management (or Mobile Device Management - MDM) is commonly used by organizations to control and monitor devices remotely, and it can restrict many functionalities. If your iPad has MDM installed, the following steps outline potential methods for bypassing it, which is necessary before jailbreaking.

### Deactivating Remote Management (MDM) on an iPad

> **Important Note**: Bypassing MDM can potentially violate terms of service, particularly if the iPad belongs to a school or organization. Only proceed if you have the right to manage the device.

---

#### Method 1: Using Settings (If You Have Access)

1. **Go to Settings**:
   - Open **Settings** on your iPad.

2. **Navigate to General > Device Management** (or **Profiles & Device Management**):
   - If you see **Mobile Device Management** or a profile, tap on it.

3. **Remove Profile**:
   - Tap **Remove Management**. You may need to enter a passcode if prompted.
   - If successful, this will remove the MDM profile from the iPad.

> **Note**: This method only works if the profile allows removal and if you have the required credentials.

---

#### Method 2: Using Third-Party MDM Bypass Tools (Without Credentials)

If you don’t have the necessary credentials to remove MDM through settings, you may need to use an MDM bypass tool. Here are some reputable tools:

1. **3uTools** (Windows):
   - Download **3uTools** from [the official website](http://www.3u.com/).
   - Install and open 3uTools, then connect your iPad to your computer.
   - In 3uTools, go to **Toolbox** > **Skip MDM Lock**.
   - Follow the instructions to bypass the MDM lock.

2. **iActivate** (Windows/macOS):
   - Download **iActivate** from [the iActivate website](https://iactivate.host/).
   - Install and open iActivate, connect your iPad, and follow the instructions.
   - iActivate will remove the MDM lock by temporarily bypassing it, allowing you to access your device’s full features.

3. **Tenorshare 4uKey** (Windows/macOS):
   - Download **Tenorshare 4uKey** from [the official website](https://www.tenorshare.com/).
   - Install and open 4uKey, connect your iPad, and select **Bypass MDM Lock**.
   - Follow the on-screen steps to bypass MDM on your device.

> **Note**: These tools typically require a one-time purchase or trial, so choose one that suits your needs and budget.

---

#### Method 3: Factory Reset (Erases All Data)

1. **Reset the iPad** (only if MDM was set up after the initial setup):
   - Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings**.
   - This will restore your iPad to factory settings and may remove the MDM profile if it wasn’t applied during initial setup.

2. **Setup Device Again**:
   - Follow the setup process. If MDM was part of the setup, this may not work, but if it was added later, this could remove it.

---

### Important Warnings

- **Data Loss**: Factory reset and some MDM bypass tools will erase all data on the device.
- **Jailbreak Compatibility**: Some jailbreak tools require you to bypass MDM before jailbreaking.
- **Potential Warranty Issues**: Bypassing or removing MDM might void warranties or violate terms if the device is under a management policy.

---

### After Bypassing MDM

Once MDM is removed or bypassed, you can proceed with the jailbreaking steps. Make sure to follow all prerequisites, including creating a backup of your device, as jailbreaking also carries risks.
