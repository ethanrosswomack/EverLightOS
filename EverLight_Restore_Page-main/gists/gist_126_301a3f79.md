Likely Hood of Success  

**SYSTEM**: 

**TOOL**: All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**ASSISTANT**: Based on the documents provided, here’s an analysis of the legal situation and likelihood of success for Cody Henderson's writ of mandamus claim against the City of Washington Court House:

### **1. Key Legal Arguments and Issues:**
#### Relator's Position:
- **Claim:** Cody Henderson asserts that the City of Washington Court House violated the Ohio Public Records Act by failing to respond to 60 unique public records requests within the statutory time frame.
- **Relief Sought:** Henderson is requesting a writ of mandamus compelling the City to provide the requested records and statutory damages for the delay in response.

#### Respondent's Position:
- **Criminal Case Exception:** The City argues that the requests relate to a pending criminal case against Henderson and thus fall under Ohio Revised Code (R.C.) § 149.43(G), which deems such requests as criminal discovery demands rather than public records requests.
- **Timeliness of Requests:** The City also argues that even if the requests were valid under the Public Records Act, five business days is not a reasonable amount of time to process 60 unique requests.
- **Adequate Remedy in Law:** Since Henderson had access to discovery procedures under Criminal Rule 16, a writ of mandamus is not appropriate.

---

### **2. Standard for Mandamus Relief:**
To succeed, Henderson must demonstrate:
1. A clear legal right to the requested relief.
2. A clear legal duty on the part of the City to provide the relief.
3. Lack of an adequate legal remedy through ordinary means.

---

### **3. Legal Challenges Facing Henderson:**
#### A. **Criminal Case Exception (R.C. § 149.43(G)):**
- The City’s defense is strong here. Requests tied to a criminal proceeding are generally treated as discovery requests, not public records requests. This limitation undermines Henderson’s argument that the Public Records Act applies in this case.

#### B. **Timeliness:**
- Submitting 60 unique requests on November 3, 2024, and filing a lawsuit on November 12, 2024, suggests that the time provided for the City to respond was insufficient to establish an unreasonable delay under R.C. § 149.43(B)(1).

#### C. **Adequate Remedy in Law:**
- If the documents sought were tied to Henderson’s defense in the criminal case, discovery mechanisms under Criminal Rule 16 provided an alternative remedy. This is a significant obstacle to his mandamus claim.

---

### **4. Likelihood of Success:**
- **Low:** The City has presented compelling arguments regarding the criminal case exception and the adequacy of existing remedies. Additionally, the timing of the lawsuit makes it challenging for Henderson to demonstrate that the City failed to respond within a "reasonable period."

---

### **5. Recommendations for Henderson:**
1. **Clarify the Nature of the Requests:**
   - If any requests were unrelated to the criminal case, Henderson should emphasize those distinctions to avoid the application of R.C. § 149.43(G).
   
2. **Provide Evidence of Unreasonable Delay:**
   - Document all attempts to communicate with the City and any specific delays beyond the statutory timelines.

3. **Consider Alternative Remedies:**
   - If the goal is to obtain records for a dismissed criminal case, Henderson might explore post-conviction discovery avenues or reframe his arguments under broader transparency principles.

**USER**: Please include this final response in your expanded analysis 



**TOOL**: All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s an updated and expanded analysis incorporating Cody Henderson’s final response to the motion for judgment on the pleadings:

---

### **Legal Context and Current Positions**

#### **1. Relator’s Position:**
Cody Henderson asserts the following:
- **Legal Duty:** Mark J. Pitstick, the City Director of Law, is obligated under Ohio Public Records Act (R.C. 149.43) to respond to 60 unique public records requests submitted on November 3, 2024.
- **Timeliness:** No response or records were provided despite over 60 days passing, which violates R.C. 149.43(B)(1)’s reasonable time requirement.
- **Irrelevance of Criminal Case:** Henderson argues that none of the public records requests pertain to his dismissed criminal case (CRB2400308) and thus do not fall under the exemptions of R.C. 149.43(G) or Criminal Rule 16.
- **Statutory Damages:** Henderson seeks $60,000 in statutory damages for the delay in compliance, as allowed under R.C. 149.43(C)(2).

#### **2. Respondent’s Position:**
The City of Washington Court House contends:
- **Criminal Discovery Exception:** Henderson’s requests relate to his prior criminal case, invoking R.C. 149.43(G), which reclassifies such requests as discovery demands under Criminal Rule 16.
- **Adequate Remedy:** Discovery procedures in the criminal case offered an adequate legal remedy, making mandamus inappropriate under R.C. 2731.05.
- **Reasonableness:** Responding to 60 unique requests within five business days is unreasonable under R.C. 149.43(B)(1).

---

### **Expanded Analysis of Henderson’s Response**

#### **1. Argument Against Criminal Discovery Exception (R.C. 149.43(G)):**
Henderson provides a detailed rebuttal:
- **Lack of Connection to Criminal Case:** He affirms under oath that none of the requests pertain to case CRB2400308 and argues that R.C. 149.43(G) is inapplicable as these requests are unrelated to the dismissed criminal matter.
- **Improper Application of Discovery Rules:** Henderson emphasizes that the records requested do not meet the criteria for "discoverable material" under Criminal Rule 16.
- **Dismissal of Case:** The criminal case was dismissed on November 22, 2024—prior to the filing of his amended petition. Henderson highlights that the amended petition supersedes the original petition, rendering any references to the criminal case moot under S.Ct.Prac.R. 3.13(C).

#### **2. Public Records Act Compliance:**
Henderson systematically demonstrates compliance with the Public Records Act:
- **Specificity:** The 60 requests are distinct, specific, and unrelated to any statutory exemptions in R.C. 149.43(A)(1).
- **Public Office Obligation:** The City has a clear legal duty to produce the requested records unless exempted under R.C. 149.43(A)(1), which the City has not substantiated.

#### **3. Statutory Damages:**
Henderson’s claim for damages is supported by the following:
- **Electronic Submission:** Requests were submitted via email, meeting the Act’s requirements.
- **Unreasonable Delay:** More than 60 days have passed without a response, far exceeding what could be considered a "reasonable period" under R.C. 149.43(B)(1).
- **Calculation of Damages:** Under R.C. 149.43(C)(2), he seeks $100 per request per day for a maximum of $1,000 per request, totaling $60,000.

---

### **Key Legal Precedents Supporting Henderson’s Case**
Henderson relies on established precedents to bolster his arguments:
1. **Broad Access to Records:** Courts construe the Public Records Act liberally in favor of broad access (State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hamilton Cty.).
2. **Mandamus as a Remedy:** Mandamus is the appropriate remedy for noncompliance with the Public Records Act (State ex rel. Penland v. Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction).
3. **No Need for Alternate Remedies:** Unlike in other mandamus cases, public records cases do not require proof of the absence of an adequate legal remedy (State ex rel. Caster v. Columbus).

---

### **Likelihood of Success**
#### **Factors Favoring Henderson:**
1. **Dismissal of Criminal Case:** The dismissal of case CRB2400308 removes any basis for invoking R.C. 149.43(G).
2. **Specific and Unrelated Requests:** Henderson has provided a clear record showing that his requests do not pertain to the dismissed case, making them valid under the Public Records Act.
3. **Failure to Respond:** The City has failed to produce the records or provide an exemption justification within a reasonable time frame.

#### **Challenges:**
1. **Respondent’s Delay Defense:** The City may argue that the volume and timing of the requests justify the delay.
2. **Judicial Discretion:** Courts may interpret what constitutes a "reasonable period" of delay differently, particularly for large-scale requests.

---

### **Conclusion**
Cody Henderson presents a strong argument for a peremptory writ of mandamus. His emphasis on the separation between the public records requests and the dismissed criminal case weakens the City’s defense under R.C. 149.43(G). If the court finds the City’s delay unreasonable and the records non-exempt, Henderson is likely to succeed and secure statutory damages.

Would you like assistance drafting additional responses or preparing for potential counterarguments?

**USER**: Yes please - Preparing for all potential counter arguments would be wise I think. Show Mr. Henderson and Me what your Ever Expanding Light has to reveal to us!

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Ethan! Let’s prepare a robust strategy to counter potential arguments the City may raise. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the most likely counterarguments and how Mr. Henderson can respond effectively:

---

### **1. "Unreasonable Delay" Defense**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City may argue that responding to 60 unique public records requests within a short period (five business days before filing the petition) is inherently unreasonable.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Clarify Timeline:** Highlight that the petition was filed on November 12, 2024, but the City still failed to respond even as of January 2, 2025, which constitutes a delay exceeding 60 days.
- **Volume Does Not Excuse Delay:** Cite *State ex rel. Caster v. Columbus* (2016-Ohio-8394), where courts emphasized that even voluminous requests must be fulfilled within a reasonable time unless specific exemptions apply.
- **Nature of Records:** Emphasize that the requested records likely require minimal processing, redaction, or legal review, especially since they are general public records unrelated to sensitive criminal matters.
- **Request a Specific Defense:** Demand that the City specify what actions (if any) it has taken to process the requests and justify the timeline.

---

### **2. "Criminal Discovery Exception" Defense**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City will likely maintain that the requests fall under R.C. 149.43(G), invoking the criminal discovery exemption.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Explicitly Separate Requests:** Stress that none of the requests include references to Henderson’s criminal case (CRB2400308), his role as a defendant, or documents tied to the prosecution. Reference the specific language of the emails to demonstrate this separation.
- **Dismissal of Criminal Case:** Highlight that the case was dismissed before the filing of the amended petition, nullifying any relevance of R.C. 149.43(G).
- **Statutory Language:** Argue that R.C. 149.43(G) is narrowly tailored and only applies when the records explicitly relate to an ongoing criminal case—not past cases or unrelated municipal records.

---

### **3. "Adequate Remedy at Law" Defense**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City may argue that Henderson could have pursued discovery mechanisms in the criminal case as an alternative legal remedy.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Mandamus in Public Records Cases:** Emphasize precedent (*State ex rel. Caster v. Columbus*), which states that public records cases do not require the absence of an adequate legal remedy because transparency is a primary goal.
- **Dismissed Case:** Argue that discovery mechanisms became irrelevant once the criminal case was dismissed, and the Public Records Act remains the sole avenue for obtaining municipal records.

---

### **4. "Request Lacked Specificity" Defense**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City may claim the requests were too broad, vague, or burdensome to fulfill.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Demonstrate Specificity:** Attach and reference sample requests to show they were narrowly tailored (e.g., requesting emails, meeting minutes, or specific policy documents).
- **Public Records Act Standards:** Cite *State ex rel. Penland v. Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction* (2019-Ohio-4130), where courts held that specificity in identifying public records is met when the requester provides a clear description of the records sought.
- **City’s Failure to Seek Clarification:** Argue that the City had the option to request clarification of any ambiguities under R.C. 149.43(B)(2) but failed to do so.

---

### **5. "Requests Are Exempt Under R.C. 149.43(A)(1)"**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City may claim the requested records fall under statutory exemptions, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Identify Non-Exempt Records:** Proactively demonstrate that many requests (e.g., meeting agendas, publicly shared emails) are clearly public records under R.C. 149.43(A)(1) and do not fall into any exemption category.
- **Burden of Proof on City:** Emphasize that the burden to justify exemptions lies with the City, as held in *State ex rel. McDougald v. Greene* (2020-Ohio-3686).
- **Demand a Privilege Log:** Request that the City produce a privilege log detailing which specific records are allegedly exempt and the statutory basis for exemption.

---

### **6. "Statutory Damages are Unreasonable or Exceed Limits"**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City may argue the damages sought are excessive or not supported by statute.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Statutory Basis is Clear:** Reference R.C. 149.43(C)(2), which explicitly allows $100 per day per unique request, up to $1,000 per request.
- **Court Discretion Limited:** Highlight that statutory damages are a mandatory remedy once noncompliance is established and are not subject to reduction unless the City proves good faith effort or compliance.
- **City’s Inaction:** Argue that statutory damages are warranted given the City’s complete failure to respond for over 60 days, which demonstrates bad faith.

---

### **7. Procedural Counterarguments**
#### **City’s Likely Argument:**
- The City might challenge the amended petition on procedural grounds, arguing it improperly supersedes the original petition or introduces new claims.

#### **Counterpoints:**
- **Supreme Court Practice Rules:** Cite S.Ct.Prac.R. 3.13(C), which explicitly states that amended petitions supersede original filings and require courts to disregard the original petition.
- **Timely Filing:** Demonstrate that the amended petition was filed promptly and did not materially alter the nature of the claims, only clarifying them.
- **Focus on Substantive Merits:** Argue that procedural objections are an attempt to distract from the substantive merits of the case.

---

### **Preparation for Court Presentation**
1. **Organize Evidence:**
   - Emails containing the original requests.
   - Timeline of events, including the date of the criminal case dismissal.
   - Public records definitions and statutory damages calculations.

2. **Anticipate Cross-Examination:**
   - Prepare clear responses to potential questions about why the requests were submitted while the criminal case was active.
   - Be ready to explain how the requests are unrelated to the criminal matter.

3. **Reinforce Legal Standards:**
   - Stress Ohio’s liberal interpretation of the Public Records Act and the burden on the City to justify delays or exemptions.
