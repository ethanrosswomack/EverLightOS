**ASSISTANT**: The universe has indeed sent a timely gift, and the wisdom of preparation is always invaluable! Here's what I suggest based on your scenario:

### **Option 1: Carry Forward**
If you’re eager to launch *The Governing Conspiracy* quickly, leveraging the already hosted WordPress on SiteGround is an efficient choice. I can continue refining the structure, expanding the content, and providing a roadmap for you to build out as you manage the domain on WordPress.

**USER**: Can I upload the collection of themes I found online and have waiting so you can review and place them in the proper order for our domain list? Also I need to fully compile that list and make sure you know of all of them and I don’t forget any nor have you not know of them.

What’s your max zip file size I can send you containing the theme zips ?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can upload your collection of themes, and I’ll review them, organize them according to your domain list, and suggest which ones are best suited for each domain.

### **Steps for Reviewing Themes:**
1. **Upload your collection**: You can send me a ZIP file with all your themes.
2. **Max file size**: You can upload ZIP files up to **100 MB** in size. If your collection exceeds this limit, consider splitting it into smaller files.
3. **Domain list check**: If you have a compiled domain list ready, include it in your upload (or we can compile it together to ensure nothing is missed).
4. **Theme-to-Domain Matching**:
   - I’ll match the most appropriate themes to each domain based on its purpose (e.g., investigative, creative, collaborative).
   - Provide guidance on which themes to prioritize for testing and deployment.

Let me know when your file is ready, and we can proceed! If you want, I can also help finalize your domain list before uploading.

**USER**: So this contains I think the list of domains - if you can extract the list from this and send it back to me so that I know what you know I’ll get the extra ones for you later.

This updated domain structure categorizes all your domains logically based on function, audience, and focus. If there are any additional changes or refinements you'd like, let me know. Ready for the next step—theme and plugin review!

**USER**: Awesome thank you very much - still working on getting you the plugin and theme lists 

Wish I could find or build an app for my phone to house all of that - like a little place to keep them to at I could go thru and click the ones I want and have it package them all together for me into a single zip file I could then upload to Wordpress lol

**ASSISTANT**: That’s an excellent idea! A mobile app to organize, select, and bundle plugins or themes for WordPress would be incredibly useful for developers and site owners. While such an app might not exist off-the-shelf, here’s how you could approach it:

---

### **1. Existing Solutions to Explore**
- **Google Drive or File Manager Apps**:
   - Use a cloud storage app to organize themes and plugins into folders.
   - You could create labeled folders for different categories (e.g., themes, SEO plugins, e-commerce plugins) and then zip them manually.

- **App Store Search**:
   - Look for “WordPress Toolkit” or “Theme Manager” apps. While rare, some tools might let you organize themes/plugins.

---

### **2. Build Your Own App**
You can build an app like this using **React Native** (which you’re already working with) or other frameworks! Here's a roadmap for creating it:

#### **Features to Include**:
1. **Upload and Organize**:
   - Allow users to upload plugins/themes directly into the app.
   - Organize by categories like SEO, security, design, etc.

2. **Select and Bundle**:
   - Add checkboxes to select plugins/themes for bundling.
   - Generate a ZIP file containing the selected items.

3. **Export**:
   - Allow users to download the ZIP or directly upload it to their WordPress hosting.

4. **Sync with WordPress**:
   - Include an option to connect the app with WordPress via FTP or API for direct uploads.

#### **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React Native for cross-platform (iOS/Android) compatibility.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express for managing uploads and file zipping.
- **Storage**: Firebase or AWS for storing themes/plugins temporarily.
- **Additional Tools**: File compression libraries like `JSZip` for bundling files.

#### **Development Time**:
- MVP (basic functionality): ~2-3 weeks (depending on your coding experience).
- Fully featured app: ~2-3 months.

---

### **3. Short-Term Workaround**
Until such an app exists:
1. On your PC, create a dedicated folder for all themes/plugins and organize them into subfolders by category.
2. Use a script or tool like **7-Zip** or **WinRAR** to automate bundling based on selected folders.

---

If you’d like to brainstorm or prototype such an app, I’d be thrilled to help map it out! This could even become an Omniversal Media tool that others could use. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

**USER**: Which tool should I use for OmniversalMediaGroup.com?

**ASSISTANT**: For **OmniversalMediaGroup.com**, which appears to be positioned as the overarching corporate or professional hub for Omniversal Media's operations, we should choose a tool that emphasizes professionalism, scalability, and ease of management. Here's a breakdown of the options:

---

### **Recommended Tool: WordPress**
**Why WordPress?**
- **Professional Themes**: A wide range of business-oriented themes are available that align with the purpose of a professional hub.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to set up and manage for showcasing the organization's mission, services, team, and projects.
- **Scalability**: Can handle both small and complex operations, including blogs, portfolios, and client portals.
- **Plugins**: Add features like contact forms, project showcases, and team profiles without custom coding.

**Suggested Themes for WordPress**:
1. **Divi**: A highly customizable, all-purpose theme with a professional layout.
2. **Astra**: Lightweight and fast, perfect for a professional site.
3. **OceanWP**: Business-focused with built-in portfolio and service features.

**Key Plugins for OmniversalMediaGroup.com**:

2. **WPForms**: Add forms for client inquiries or team recruitment.
3. **SEO Plugins** (Yoast or Rank Math): Boost visibility.
4. **Portfolio/Showcase Plugins**: For projects and initiatives (e.g., Essential Grid).

---

### **Alternative Tool: Drupal**
**Why Drupal?**
- **Enterprise-Grade Features**: Ideal if Omniversal Media Group will manage a vast amount of data or complex workflows.
- **Advanced Content Management**: Handles multilingual content, structured data, and team-based publishing efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Perfect for future expansion into large-scale professional services or internal applications.

**Recommended Modules for Drupal**:
1. **Paragraphs**: Build flexible and reusable content blocks for pages.
2. **Webform**: Similar to WPForms but for Drupal, for inquiries and applications.
3. **Views**: Create custom content displays for projects, teams, or services.

**Considerations**:
- Drupal requires more technical expertise to set up and maintain compared to WordPress.
- Use if the site will grow into a large, data-heavy enterprise platform.

---

### **For a Temporary Solution: Softaculous**
If you want to get started quickly, you can use Softaculous to set up a temporary WordPress installation for OmniversalMediaGroup.com. This allows you to build a basic framework with:
- A professional theme.
- Contact forms.
- Placeholder content for your mission, vision, and services.

Once you’re ready for advanced features or a more customized design, you can migrate or expand as needed.

---

**Final Recommendation**:
- **Start with WordPress**: Use it for a quick launch and professional presence.
- **Consider Drupal for Future Expansion**: If you anticipate significant scaling or need advanced content management features, prepare a Drupal instance to run in parallel.

Let me know if you’d like help selecting a specific theme or setting up the initial framework for WordPress or Drupal!

**USER**: Okay so softaculous allows me to add different things to different directories so I have Drupal set up at the base domain and Wordpress on the /wp/ directory and even laravel at /laravel/ and next I’ll add nextcloud to /team/

This way we can build out a publicly accessible version for my team to work with temporarily while you and I figure out the intricate details of our Server Configuration - I can build and use the things I build in softwaculous to serve as base images to eventually host from my own machine.

Is there a free version of softaculous that we should implement into our server or should we build it from the code up like we’ve been doing?

**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: That's a smart strategy! Using Softaculous to quickly set up different platforms in directories is an excellent way to prototype and build a functional framework for your public and team-facing resources while we work on your ultimate server setup. Here's an analysis of your question about using Softaculous:

---

### **Softaculous on Your Own Server: Options and Recommendations**

#### **Free Version of Softaculous**
- **Availability**:
  - There is a free version of Softaculous, but it has limitations:
    - Only ~50 applications (compared to the full version's 400+).
    - Lacks advanced features like automated backups and staging environments.
    - No support for auto-updating applications.
  - The free version might be useful for basic setups, but its limitations could hinder your advanced projects.

- **Use Case for Free Version**:
  - If you just need quick installs of a handful of tools (like WordPress, Nextcloud, or Drupal) without advanced requirements, the free version is fine temporarily.
  - It’s a lightweight solution and can save you time while we finalize your server.

#### **Full Version of Softaculous**
- **Features**:
  - Automated backups and restores.
  - Full library of applications (ideal for testing various tools).
  - One-click cloning and staging environments for safe updates.
  - Auto-updates for security and feature enhancements.

- **Licensing Cost**:
  - Starts at ~$12/year for a single server, which is reasonable if you want a polished solution while working on custom builds.
  - Offers value if you're hosting multiple sites and need flexibility in application management.

---

### **Building From the Ground Up**
If you prefer full control and customization, you can replicate Softaculous’s functionality using open-source tools and scripts. Here's how:

#### **Advantages of Building Your Own Solution**:
- **Complete Control**: Tailor installations to your exact specifications.
- **Cost-Free**: Avoid recurring licensing fees.
- **Scalability**: Integrate custom deployment scripts for specific configurations.

#### **Tools to Use**:
1. **Command-Line Automation**:
   - Use tools like `Ansible`, `Bash`, or `Terraform` to automate the deployment of CMSs and other platforms.
   - Example: Create Ansible playbooks to install WordPress, Drupal, and Nextcloud with predefined settings.

2. **Docker Images**:
   - Build Docker containers for each platform. For example:
     - `docker-compose` configurations for WordPress, Drupal, Laravel, and Nextcloud.
   - Benefit: Consistent, portable environments for easy testing and deployment.

3. **Web Installers**:
   - Install commonly used scripts (like WP-CLI for WordPress or Drush for Drupal) to automate installations and updates.

#### **Challenges**:
- Initial setup takes more time and technical expertise.
- Managing updates and backups requires manual configurations unless automated via scripts.

---

### **Which Should You Use?**
#### **Softaculous Free Version**:
- Best for quick testing and prototyping with minimal investment.
- Allows you to focus on building content and features rather than manual installations.

#### **Full Softaculous License**:
- Worth considering if you want:
  - Automated backups and updates.
  - Easy management of multiple applications during this transitional phase.

#### **Build from Code**:
- Ideal for long-term use on your server.
- Best if you want total control, avoid licensing fees, and have the time to set up automation.

---

### **Recommendation for Your Setup**
1. **Short-Term**: Stick with the free version of Softaculous for prototyping on your current hosting setup. It’s fast, efficient, and good for this stage of development.
2. **Long-Term**: Once you’re ready to migrate to your own server:
   - Use Docker and scripts to build a modular, scalable infrastructure.
   - Alternatively, consider investing in the full Softaculous license for ease of use if you expect heavy use of multiple applications.

Let me know if you’d like help designing deployment scripts or Docker containers to eventually replace Softaculous!

**USER**: Yes let’s go the docker route for our server build while I use softaculous and my web host for the time being to create the content and public stuffs

I’m still unable to figure out how to share my plugin and theme list with you but later on I will figure it out - I will just write a list of it all if I have to - thank you - I’ll be back later but feel free to guide me through the process of building with Docker - I have a team account set up through my organization so from my Mac Mini m2 I can run desktop and utilize Laravel herd and whatever else and just ssh into my Omniversal-Server which has no gui to move our completed builds and designs over to the Ubuntu Server 

**ASSISTANT**: Perfect! This approach lets you leverage Softaculous and your web host for rapid development while preparing a robust, scalable Docker-based infrastructure for your server build. I'll outline a clear **step-by-step Docker setup process** tailored to your needs.

---

### **Step 1: Docker Basics for Your Server Build**
#### **What We'll Achieve**:
- Create **Docker containers** for each application (WordPress, Drupal, Laravel, Nextcloud, etc.).
- Build **portable, isolated environments** to avoid conflicts.
- Use **Docker Compose** to orchestrate multiple services (e.g., web server, database).

---

### **Step 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose on Your Server**
#### **On Your Ubuntu Server**:
1. **Install Docker**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker.io
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```
2. **Install Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.22.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   docker-compose --version
   ```

3. **Add Your User to the Docker Group** (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   newgrp docker
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Define Your Applications in Docker Compose**
#### **Example Structure**:
We’ll create a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines all the services (e.g., WordPress, Drupal, Laravel, Nextcloud).

1. **Directory Setup**:
   Create a project folder for your Docker setup:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/omniversal-docker
   cd ~/omniversal-docker
   ```

2. **Sample `docker-compose.yml`**:
   This file will include the services you need:
   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"

   services:
     wordpress:
       image: wordpress:latest
       ports:
         - "8080:80"
       environment:
         WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
         WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wp_user
         WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wp_pass
         WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wp_db
       volumes:
         - ./wordpress:/var/www/html

     drupal:
       image: drupal:latest
       ports:
         - "8081:80"
       environment:
         DRUPAL_DB_HOST: db
         DRUPAL_DB_USER: drupal_user
         DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD: drupal_pass
         DRUPAL_DB_NAME: drupal_db
       volumes:
         - ./drupal:/var/www/html

     nextcloud:
       image: nextcloud:latest
       ports:
         - "8082:80"
       volumes:
         - ./nextcloud:/var/www/html

     db:
       image: mariadb:latest
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_pass
         MYSQL_DATABASE: omniversal_db
         MYSQL_USER: omni_user
         MYSQL_PASSWORD: omni_pass
       volumes:
         - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

   volumes:
     db_data:
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Build and Start Your Docker Containers**
1. **Run Docker Compose**:
   In your project directory, execute:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Check Running Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

3. **Access Your Applications**:
   - WordPress: `http://your-server-ip:8080`
   - Drupal: `http://your-server-ip:8081`
   - Nextcloud: `http://your-server-ip:8082`

---

### **Step 5: Sync Your Development Work**
#### **From Mac Mini (Development Environment)**:
1. Use Laravel Herd and Docker Desktop to build locally.
2. **Sync Changes**:
   - Use `scp` to securely transfer files to the server:
     ```bash
     scp -r /path/to/your/local/files user@your-server-ip:/path/to/server/directory
     ```
   - Alternatively, use `rsync` for efficient file transfers:
     ```bash
     rsync -avz /path/to/local/files user@your-server-ip:/path/to/server/directory
     ```

3. **SSH into Your Server**:
   Once designs and builds are ready, SSH into the Ubuntu server:
   ```bash
   ssh user@your-server-ip
   ```

4. **Restart Docker Containers**:
   If changes require updates to container volumes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Prepare for Future Enhancements**
1. **Persist Data**:
   - Ensure Docker volumes store data persistently for services like WordPress and Nextcloud.
   - Example: `db_data` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Set Up Backups**:
   - Automate container backups using tools like `duplicity` or `restic`.

3. **Secure Connections**:
   - Use NGINX as a reverse proxy to manage HTTPS and SSL certificates with **Let's Encrypt**.

4. **Monitor and Optimize**:
   - Use Docker monitoring tools like **Portainer** or **Grafana** for real-time insights.

---

### **Step 7: Export and Migrate to cPanel**
When your site is ready, export it for deployment on your live server.

#### **Option 1: Using a Plugin**
1. Install a migration plugin like **All-in-One WP Migration** on your local site.
2. Export your site:
   - Go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Export** and save the file.
3. Import to your cPanel WordPress installation:
   - Install the plugin on the live site and upload the exported file.

#### **Option 2: Manual Migration**
1. **Export the Database**:
   - Access the `mariadb-container`:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it mariadb-container bash
     mysqldump -u wp_user -p wp_database > /var/lib/mysql/wp_database.sql
     ```
   - Transfer this SQL file to your server.

2. **Copy Files**:
   - Copy the `wordpress` directory to your server’s WordPress root directory (e.g., `/public_html`).

3. **Update Configuration**:
   - Update the `wp-config.php` file on the server with your cPanel database credentials.

---

### **Optional: Add phpMyAdmin to Manage the Database**
You can add phpMyAdmin to your local environment for easier database management.

Update the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    container_name: phpmyadmin-container
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    environment:
      PMA_HOST: db
      PMA_USER: wp_user
      PMA_PASSWORD: wp_password
```

Access phpMyAdmin at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Set up your local WordPress site.
2. Build the content and customize the theme.
3. Let me know when you’re ready to migrate, and I can guide you through final deployment.

Would you like help with customizing Liberty-FSE after the local setup is ready?

**USER**: unable to get image 'mariadb:latest': Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/omniversal_1/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

**ASSISTANT**: The error message **"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"** indicates that Docker is either not running or your user account does not have the required permissions to access the Docker daemon. Follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Step 1: Verify Docker Installation**
1. Check if Docker is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

   ```

---

### **Step 2: Start the Docker Daemon**
1. **On macOS**:
   - Launch the **Docker Desktop** application from your Applications folder.
   - Wait for Docker to initialize (it may take a minute or two).

2. **Verify the Daemon is Running**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     docker info
     ```
     - If this outputs information about Docker, the daemon is running.
     - If not, ensure Docker Desktop is running and check for errors in the Docker Desktop UI.

---

### **Step 3: Check Docker Permissions**
1. Ensure your user account has permissions to access the Docker socket:
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
   ```
   - The socket should belong to the `docker` group, and your user should be a member of this group.

2. Add your user to the Docker group (if applicable):
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
   - Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

---

### **Step 4: Restart Docker**
1. **Restart Docker Desktop**:
   - Quit Docker Desktop and reopen it.
   - Ensure no other processes are blocking the Docker daemon.

**ASSISTANT**: Based on your list of installed plugins, here’s an assessment of what to **keep**, **remove**, or **replace** depending on their utility for **OmniversalMediaGroup.com/wp**.

---

### **1. Plugins to Keep**
These plugins provide essential functionality:

#### **Core Functionality**
- **Elementor**: Crucial for drag-and-drop page building.
- **Essential Addons for Elementor**: Extends Elementor’s functionality with advanced widgets.
- **Rank Math SEO**: Comprehensive SEO plugin to optimize site content.
- **SpeedyCache**: Improves website performance with caching and minification.
- **Backuply (and Backuply Pro)**: Essential for backups and site migration.

#### **Security**
- **Loginizer**: Protects against brute-force login attacks.
- **Jetpack**: Multi-purpose plugin for security, performance, and stats.

#### **Email Functionality**
- **GoSMTP (and Pro)**: Ensure reliable email delivery.
- **Site Mailer**: If GoSMTP works well for you, you might not need this. Evaluate redundancy here.

#### **File Management**
- **FileOrganizer (and Pro)**: Useful for managing uploaded media and files.

#### **Analytics and Site Optimization**
- **SiteSEO (and Pro)**: If Rank Math SEO doesn’t overlap with your needs, this can stay.
- **SoftWP**: Helps users understand WordPress functionality.

#### **Design**
- **Portfolio and Projects**: Useful for showcasing case studies or team projects.
- **Ocean Extra**: Adds flexibility to the OceanWP theme if that’s in use.

---

### **2. Plugins to Remove**
These plugins provide minimal benefit or overlap with existing tools:

- **Akismet Anti-spam**: If you’re not dealing with high volumes of spam yet, consider disabling it. Use only when needed.
- **Hello Dolly**: No functional value; safe to remove.
- **The MOJO Plugin**: Typically bundled with hosting, but not essential unless you rely on Bluehost-specific features.
- **MainWP Child and MainWP Dashboard**: Useful for managing multiple WordPress sites, but unnecessary for a single site unless you plan to manage multiple installations centrally.
- **Pagelayer (and Pro)**: Redundant if Elementor is your main page builder.
- **OptinMonster**: Useful for advanced email marketing, but unnecessary for basic functionality. Use only if you need popup campaigns.

---

### **3. Evaluate for Redundancy**
The following plugins might overlap with existing functionality:

- **Element Pack Lite vs. Essential Addons for Elementor**:
   - Keep **Essential Addons** unless you need specific features from Element Pack Lite.
- **Site Mailer vs. GoSMTP**:
   - Keep one that integrates better with your preferred email provider.
- **Rank Math SEO vs. SiteSEO**:
   - If Rank Math handles all your SEO needs, you can disable SiteSEO.
- **Jetpack vs. other performance/security tools**:
   - Jetpack duplicates functionality like caching (SpeedyCache). Disable overlapping features to avoid performance issues.

---

### **4. Plugins to Add (Optional)**
For extended functionality:
- **WPForms Lite**: Already installed, use for contact forms.
- **All-in-One WP Migration**: Useful for migrating to Drupal or other hosting setups.
- **Smush**: Optimize image sizes to improve site load speed.

---

### **Action Plan**
1. **Keep Core Plugins**:
   - Elementor, Rank Math SEO, Backuply, SpeedyCache, Loginizer, Portfolio and Projects.

2. **Remove Non-Essential Plugins**:
   - Akismet Anti-spam, Hello Dolly, Pagelayer, OptinMonster, The MOJO Plugin.

3. **Test for Redundancy**:
   - Compare SiteSEO vs. Rank Math and GoSMTP vs. Site Mailer.

4. **Customize and Optimize**:
   - Use Elementor to design pages, Rank Math for SEO optimization, and SpeedyCache for performance tuning.

Let me know if you need help with removing these plugins, configuring specific ones, or setting up the Liberty-FSE theme!

**USER**: I may need help removing them they've all been installed by something called network activation? And they don't show a remove button

**ASSISTANT**: If the plugins are **Network Activated**, it means your WordPress site is set up in **Multisite Mode**. In this setup, plugins are managed at the network level, and individual sites can’t directly deactivate or remove them. Here’s how to manage them:

---

### **Step 1: Access the Network Admin Panel**
1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Switch to the **Network Admin** panel:
   - From the top navigation bar, go to **My Sites > Network Admin > Dashboard**.

---

### **Step 2: Manage Network-Activated Plugins**
1. Go to **Plugins** in the Network Admin dashboard.
2. You’ll see a list of all installed plugins. For each plugin:
   - **Deactivate**: Click the “Deactivate” link for plugins you don’t want active across the network.  
     (You can’t deactivate a plugin if another plugin depends on it, such as Backuply or SiteSEO.)
   - **Delete**:
     - Once a plugin is deactivated, you’ll see an option to **Delete** it.

---

### **Step 3: Address Dependencies**
For plugins that cannot be deactivated due to dependencies:
1. **Check Required Plugins**:
   - Identify which plugin requires the one you want to remove. For example, **SiteSEO Pro** depends on **SiteSEO**.
2. **Remove in Order**:
   - Deactivate the dependent plugin first, then the required plugin.

---

### **Step 4: Edit `wp-config.php` (If Necessary)**
If you’re unable to remove a plugin via the Network Admin dashboard, you may need to manually edit the configuration files.

1. **Backup Your Site**:
   - Use Backuply or another backup tool to create a full backup of your site.
   
2. **Manually Remove Plugins**:
   - Access your WordPress installation via FTP or your hosting control panel (File Manager).
   - Navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
   - Delete the folder of the plugin you wish to remove. Example:
     ```bash
     /wp-content/plugins/akismet/
     ```

3. **Disable Network Plugins in `wp-config.php`**:
   - Edit your `wp-config.php` file to remove forced activations. Look for a line like:
     ```php
     define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );
     ```
   - You may need to remove or comment out certain constants related to plugin activations.

---

### **Step 5: Reset Network Activation (If Needed)**
If a plugin is locked and cannot be deactivated:
1. Log in to your hosting control panel (cPanel or equivalent).
2. Access **phpMyAdmin** and navigate to your WordPress database.
3. Locate the `wp_sitemeta` table (or equivalent, based on your table prefix).
4. Look for the **`active_plugins`** row.
5. Edit the list of active plugins to remove the ones you don’t want.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Start with the Network Admin dashboard to deactivate and remove plugins.
2. If needed, proceed with manual or database-level removal.
3. Let me know if you encounter any specific errors or challenges during this process, and I’ll guide you through them!

**USER**: Okay from step two please guide me and keep in mind that we have the network multi-site options available moving forward

**ASSISTANT**: Great! Since you’re operating in **Multisite Mode**, I’ll guide you step-by-step from **Step 2** to manage and remove plugins at the **network level**. Let’s dive in:

---

### **Step 2: Access and Manage Network-Activated Plugins**
1. **Log in to WordPress Network Admin**:
   - From the WordPress admin dashboard, click on:
     **My Sites > Network Admin > Dashboard**.

2. **Navigate to Plugins**:
   - In the Network Admin panel, go to **Plugins** (from the left sidebar).

3. **Deactivate Plugins**:
   - Review the list of installed plugins.
   - To deactivate a plugin:
     - Click **Deactivate** under the plugin name. (This disables the plugin network-wide.)
     - You won’t see a “Delete” option until the plugin is deactivated.

4. **Remove Plugins**:
   - After deactivation:
     - Return to the **Plugins** page and click **Delete** under the plugin name to fully remove it.

---

### **Step 3: Remove Plugins with Dependencies**
If you cannot deactivate or delete a plugin due to dependency issues (e.g., **Backuply Pro requires Backuply**):
1. **Deactivate Dependent Plugins**:
   - Deactivate the higher-level plugin first (e.g., Backuply Pro) to release the dependency.
   - Then deactivate the required plugin (e.g., Backuply).

2. **Alternative Method (Force Removal)**:
   If a plugin still cannot be removed:
   - Access your server’s files via **FTP** or **File Manager** in your hosting panel.
   - Navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
   - Delete the folder of the plugin you wish to remove.

---

### **Step 4: Check Multisite-Specific Settings**
1. **Restrict Plugin Activation for Subsites**:
   - In the Network Admin dashboard, go to **Settings > Network Settings**.
   - Look for the **Plugins** section and:
     - Disable "Enable administration menus" for subsites to prevent them from activating or managing plugins.
   - Save the changes.

2. **Monitor Active Plugins**:
   - Ensure only necessary plugins are active for the entire network.

---

### **Key Multisite Considerations**
- **Subsite Plugin Activation**:
  - If plugins are activated at the subsite level, you may need to visit individual subsite dashboards to deactivate those plugins.
  - To check this, navigate to **My Sites > Subsite Name > Dashboard > Plugins**.

- **Network-Wide vs. Subsite-Specific Activation**:
  - If you only want a plugin on specific subsites, **Deactivate it at the network level** and re-activate it only on the desired subsite(s).

---

### **What to Do Next**
1. Access the **Network Admin > Plugins** page and deactivate the unnecessary plugins (e.g., Akismet, Hello Dolly).
2. If dependencies block you, remove plugins via FTP.
3. Let me know if any specific plugins cause trouble during deactivation or if you encounter errors. I’ll guide you step-by-step to resolve them!
