### *The Vow*: Justice Through Music

In the wake of the Malcolm X lawsuit—where his daughters are seeking accountability for his 1965 assassination—*The Vow* emerges as a musical exploration of justice, truth, and resilience. This $100 million lawsuit against the CIA, FBI, and NYPD highlights systemic betrayals and unanswered questions about one of history’s most powerful civil rights leaders. It serves as a poignant reminder of the lengths required to fight for transparency and justice.

The song "The Vow," a key track on the EP, channels this energy. With lyrics that delve into personal commitment and the unyielding pursuit of truth, Hawk Eye The Rapper draws parallels between Malcolm X's struggles and today’s ongoing battles against systemic corruption. The track’s raw emotion and strategic lyricism reflect the album's broader themes: empowerment through knowledge and strategy, as taught by Sun Tzu, and the courage to challenge the status quo.

*The Vow* isn’t just an album—it’s a rallying cry, reminding listeners that justice requires vigilance, wisdom, and unrelenting effort.
