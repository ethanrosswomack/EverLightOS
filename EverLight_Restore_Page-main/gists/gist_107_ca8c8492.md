# Cody's Writ Documents

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Hey EverLight do you remember the 3 documents for Cody's writ of mandamus I shared the other day?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: I don't currently have those documents saved or recalled. If you'd like to share them again or provide details about the documents, I can help you review, revise, or organize them as needed!

**USER**: Here are the three files in question 

I have a request from Mr. Henderson himself. Below are his words.

"Ask EverLight to analyze all of these documents objectively and provide a detailed court decision as if you are a Supreme Court of Ohio Justice with a fair and independent application of the Law"

**SYSTEM**: 

**TOOL**: All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**ASSISTANT**: I will provide an analysis of the documents, assuming the role of a Supreme Court Justice in Ohio. Below is the decision structured as a court opinion:

---

**SUPREME COURT OF OHIO**  
**Case No. 24-1585**  
**Relator: Cody Ryan Henderson**  
**Respondent: City of Washington Court House**

**Opinion Delivered by Justice EverLight**

---

### **Introduction**
This matter concerns a petition for a writ of mandamus filed by the relator, Cody Ryan Henderson, against the respondent, the City of Washington Court House, seeking the production of sixty separate public records under Ohio's Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43. The respondent argues that the records sought are discovery requests related to a criminal case against the relator, and thus, exempt under R.C. 149.43(G).

---

### **Facts**
The relator submitted sixty public records requests to the respondent's City Director of Law, Mark J. Pitstick, via email on November 3, 2024. The criminal case referenced by the respondent, CRB2400308, was dismissed on November 22, 2024, before the relator filed the amended petition on December 5, 2024.

The respondent has not produced the requested records or responded substantively to the requests, asserting that the requests fall within the purview of criminal discovery, governed by Criminal Rule 16, rather than public records law.

---

### **Legal Analysis**

#### **1. Jurisdiction and Mandamus Standard**
Under R.C. 149.43(C)(1)(b), a mandamus action is the appropriate remedy for individuals denied access to public records. To obtain the writ, the relator must demonstrate:
1. A clear legal right to the requested relief.
2. A clear legal duty on the part of the respondent to provide that relief.
3. The lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

#### **2. Application of R.C. 149.43(G)**
The respondent claims that R.C. 149.43(G) exempts the records from public disclosure as they pertain to criminal discovery. However, the relator asserts that none of the requested records relate to CRB2400308. Furthermore, the criminal case was dismissed before the amended petition, rendering discovery mechanisms under Criminal Rule 16 inapplicable.

The evidence supports the relator’s contention that the records do not qualify as "discoverable materials" under Criminal Rule 16. The respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to show a direct connection between the records and the dismissed criminal case.

#### **3. Reasonableness of Delay**
Under R.C. 149.43(B)(1), public records must be provided within a reasonable period. Sixty days have elapsed since the requests, with no substantive response from the respondent. Given the volume of requests, this delay exceeds what could be considered reasonable under the circumstances.

#### **4. Statutory Damages**
R.C. 149.43(C)(2) entitles the requester to statutory damages of $100 per day for each unique request when a public office fails to comply. The relator has demonstrated compliance with the statutory prerequisites, including submission via electronic means and a lack of response within a reasonable timeframe.

---

### **Conclusion**
The respondent has failed to fulfill its statutory duty under R.C. 149.43. The requested records do not fall under any statutory exemption, including R.C. 149.43(G). The relator is entitled to:
1. A writ of mandamus compelling the respondent to produce the sixty public records.
2. Statutory damages of $1,000 per request, totaling $60,000, for the respondent’s unreasonable delay.

**The writ of mandamus is granted.**  

**It is so ordered.**

Let me know if you need further elaboration or adjustments to this analysis.

**USER**: EverLight and what percent chance do you see this going in Mr. Henderson's favor?

**ASSISTANT**: Based on the analysis of the documents provided, **Mr. Henderson's case appears to have a strong chance of success** in obtaining a favorable ruling for the following reasons:

### **Key Factors Favoring Mr. Henderson**
1. **Compliance with R.C. 149.43**:  
   - The public records requested meet the definition of "public records" under R.C. 149.011(G).
   - There is no clear evidence tying these records to the dismissed criminal case.
   - The respondent failed to produce the records within a reasonable time.

2. **Lack of Statutory Exemption**:  
   - The respondent's reliance on R.C. 149.43(G) as a defense is weak because the criminal case was dismissed prior to the amended petition. The alleged exemption under Criminal Rule 16 does not apply to non-discoverable materials or after the case's dismissal.

3. **Established Precedents**:  
   - Ohio courts have consistently interpreted the Public Records Act liberally in favor of access. This includes issuing writs of mandamus when public offices fail to respond in a reasonable time without a valid exemption.

4. **Unreasonable Delay**:  
   - The delay in responding (60 days) is excessive given the nature of the requests, which is likely to support a finding of noncompliance.

5. **Statutory Damages**:  
   - If the court rules in favor of Mr. Henderson, statutory damages under R.C. 149.43(C)(2) will be awarded, given the clear-cut nature of the violation.

### **Potential Weaknesses**
- **Volume of Requests**: The court may consider the large number of requests (60) and the administrative burden placed on the respondent. However, this does not absolve the respondent of their statutory duty to comply.
- **Procedural Concerns**: Any procedural missteps by Mr. Henderson, such as unclear descriptions or improper filing, could slightly reduce his chances, though no such issues are evident in the documents provided.

### **Estimated Likelihood of Success**
Based on the strength of the legal arguments and the lack of a compelling defense from the respondent, Mr. Henderson's chances of a favorable ruling exceed **80-85%**.

This estimate assumes:
1. The court focuses on the public records law's plain language.
2. The respondent does not provide additional evidence linking the requests to the criminal case.

If you’d like a deeper dive into potential strategies to bolster this case further, let me know!

**USER**: And can you give me a numbered percent?

**ASSISTANT**: I would assess Mr. Henderson's chances of success at **85%.**

**USER**: Wow! Can you give me a real life analogy of what "85%" looks like?

**ASSISTANT**: Sure! An **85% chance** is like:

- **Weather Forecast**: Hearing there's an 85% chance of sunshine tomorrow. You’d likely leave your umbrella at home because the odds strongly favor a sunny day, though there's still a small chance of clouds.

- **Basketball Free Throws**: Watching a professional basketball player like Stephen Curry take a free throw. With his high success rate (around 85-90%), you're confident the ball will go in, but there’s a slight chance of a miss.

- **Board Games**: Rolling a six-sided die and needing a result of 2 or higher to win. With 5 out of 6 favorable outcomes, you're almost certain to succeed, though there’s a slim chance you’ll roll a 1.

In legal terms, an 85% chance means Mr. Henderson’s case is very solid and likely to prevail, but unexpected factors—like unforeseen court interpretations or procedural issues—could still marginally alter the outcome.
