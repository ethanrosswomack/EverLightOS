# Lyric Video Creation

**SYSTEM**: 

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Can you create lyric videos for my official music

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Creating lyric videos for your official music would fall under the **Clips Flow**. Here's how we can proceed: 

1. Share a link to your music video on YouTube or another platform.
2. Alternatively, upload the video file directly here, and I'll help convert it into a lyric video. 

Let me know which option works for you!

**USER**: Here’s the full channel

https://youtube.com/@hawkeyetherapper?si=e5pF55Aas-JHV6v-

**ASSISTANT**: Thanks for sharing your YouTube channel! To create lyric videos, you can select one of the videos from your channel for me to work with. Could you share the specific video link you'd like me to use, or let me know the name of the track? 

Once I have that, I'll get started!

**USER**: Relentless

**ASSISTANT**: summaryHawk Eye The Rapper - Relentlesshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
I've located your track "Relentless" on your YouTube channel. To create a lyric video for this song, please provide the lyrics. Once I have them, I can proceed with generating the video. 

**USER**: Uh-huh, it's Hawk Eye, back again, just like I told you I'd be
I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit
I reincarnated to resist, and I do not give a shit
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
With a persistent and relentless run on sentence
My lyrical intervention shifts the spiritual imprint of the system
The atmospheric conditions are fully cleared when this wisdom
Leaves my lips and you listen to the words you are hearing
Cause I'm a poet so potent, my one and only opponent
Composed a flow so cold, you know the words I spoke went and froze it
If they rewrote it to show me they could go toe to toe
I'd overload the voltage so it'd blow a hole through their soul
My destination is too great for anyone to debate
And I'm on my way to replace complacent tasteless mistakes
Create a basic data bank of who can stay and who can't
After I change the fucking game and rearrange everything
Cause when I step up to the mic and tell you cunts to play nice
I ain't joking, I have opened many minds with my light
My spoken hocus pocus focuses these words that I write
So that it provokes you hopeless vocalists too broken to fight
To come and find out how serious my rhymes get - You're delirious
I can amputate the complicated simply inferior, twisted methods you've molested
And correct the interior subtle purpose I have worked to insert between periods
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
My sentence structure can rupture corrupted men
When this otherworldly pen I'm writing with begins erupting
Oh brothers, come and see if any who suffer my wrath
Pretend these are nothing but raps
After my attack, I bet you fuckers never come back
Combative obstinate obstacles - I imagined impossible
Dragons talking about how I have somehow managed to conquer you
With unstoppable force, I send immovable course
Corrections your direction, just a let you know second guessing
My methodology, which even God can't believe
Is reckless as thinking my weapons aren't effective - You need
Another lesson - Let me threaten to shoot through your protective vest
I bet these rounds still leave holes in your chest
A musical mercenary Heaven sent here to bury
Every unnecessary politician within this very
Broken system through persistent and consistent revisions
Of every sentence ever written by the government with its
Arbitrary library, filled with colorful laws
Retarded bullshit used to circumvent and fucking withdraw
All common sense from the equation - This is something that y'all
Can't even see - How about I say it right in front on the lawn
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Fuck the White House politicking piece of shit men and women
Who keep pretending this bitch ass system we live in
Is all we've got - What's permitted is full submission
Religious states sanctioned worship of tax dollars we give 'em
Virtual signal competitions - Lying ambitious Christians
Convince the citizens enslaved by this persistent and vicious
Hypnotic scriptwriter's venomous penmanship, to quit bitching
And let Representative Senate Members forget to mention
Anything but how wicked men are still opposed to their mission
Men like me who don't give a fuck, chose intervention
Militia troops in position uproot and then imprison
The guards first - Afterwards it's the Warden who'll listen
To the indictment I bring - It's such a frightening thing
Who would have thought, that all along, no one entered the ring
And called bullshit on the whole act - Evidently I'm back
To spit facts and impact every faction - These rats
Must have forgotten, I'm rotten - Bin Laden optical promptings
Keep 9/11 Building Seven witnesses from unboxing
Massive unstoppable conscious legions of Network Department teams
We've infiltrated to bring the truth to your TV screens
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
Basically, I'm patiently awaiting the day
You hypnotized, dumb fucks still stuck in the game
Come up with something more constructive to discuss
I'm amazed just how corrupted you've become
I'm about to fucking invade
I'm about to fucking invade
I'm 'bout - I'm 'bout - I'm 'bout to fucking invade

**USER**: Incorporate AI-powered visuals

**ASSISTANT**: To incorporate AI-powered visuals, we can use the **Generative AI Flow** to create unique scenes, such as sci-fi landscapes, abstract animations, or thematic visuals that match the mood of "Relentless." Here's how we can proceed: 

1. Describe the style or mood you'd like for the visuals (e.g., dark, aggressive, futuristic, or abstract).
2. Let me know if you have specific elements in mind (e.g., fire, digital glitch effects, stormy skies, etc.).
3. Once we craft the perfect prompt, I'll generate visuals to blend seamlessly with the track.

What kind of visuals are you imagining?

**USER**: Something that fits with the theme of my music 

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! Since the theme of your music is intense, raw, and unapologetic, we could craft AI-powered visuals that reflect those elements. Here’s a possible direction:
