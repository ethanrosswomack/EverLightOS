# DNF Certbot Installation Fix

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: sudo dno install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y says "Error" Unable to find a match: certbot python3-certbot-nginx


**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: The error indicates that the package manager cannot find the `certbot` or `python3-certbot-nginx` packages. This could happen due to several reasons:

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Ensure Your Package Repository is Updated**
   Run:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```
   After updating, try installing the packages again.

2. **Enable the Required Repository**
   Certbot and its plugins may not be available in the default repositories. Enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install epel-release -y
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

3. **Install Certbot**
   Try installing Certbot again after enabling the EPEL repository:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
   ```

4. **Check the Availability of Certbot**
   If Certbot is still not found, try enabling the Snap package manager and installing Certbot via Snap:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install snapd -y
   sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
   sudo snap install core
   sudo snap refresh core
   sudo snap install --classic certbot
   sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
   ```

5. **Install Certbot Nginx Plugin via Snap**
   After installing Certbot with Snap, you can add the Nginx plugin:
   ```bash
   sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
   sudo snap install certbot-nginx
   ```

6. **Verify Installation**
   Check if Certbot is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   certbot --version
   ```

If these steps do not resolve the issue, let me know the specific Red Hat or Fedora-based distribution version you are using, and I’ll tailor additional steps.

**USER**: how do I point my domains towards my nginx server?


**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: To point your domain(s) towards your Nginx server, you need to configure both your domain's DNS settings and your Nginx server. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Configure DNS Settings for Your Domain**

#### a. **Log into Your Domain Registrar's Control Panel**
   - If you're using DreamHost (as you mentioned), log in to the DreamHost panel.
   - Navigate to **Manage Domains** (or a similar section, depending on the provider).

#### b. **Create or Update DNS Records**
   You need to create `A` or `CNAME` records to point your domain to your server's public IP address.

   - **A Record**: If your server has a static IP address, set an A record that points your domain to your server's IP address.
     - **Host**: `@` (This represents the root domain, e.g., `omniversal.team`)
     - **Value**: Your server’s public IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.123`)
     - **TTL**: 1 hour (or whatever is default)

     If you want to create subdomains (e.g., `www.omniversal.team`), you can add an A record for that subdomain as well.

     Example:
     - **Host**: `www`
     - **Value**: `192.0.2.123`

   - **CNAME Record**: If your server has a dynamic IP address or you prefer using a domain name, you can set a CNAME record pointing to a hostname.
     - **Host**: `@`
     - **Value**: Your dynamic IP provider's hostname (e.g., `example.dyndns.org`)
     - **TTL**: 1 hour

   Once you’ve updated the DNS settings, it may take some time (usually up to 24 hours) for the changes to propagate across the internet.

### 2. **Configure Nginx to Handle Your Domain**

#### a. **Edit Nginx Configuration**

1. **Navigate to Nginx Configuration Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
   ```

2. **Create a New Server Block for Your Domain**:
   Create a new configuration file for your domain. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.team
   ```

3. **Set Up a Basic Server Block**:
   Add the following content to the configuration file, replacing `omniversal.team` with your domain name:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name omniversal.team www.omniversal.team;

       root /var/www/omniversal.team;
       index index.html;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Create a Symlink in `sites-enabled`**:
   Enable this server block by creating a symlink in the `sites-enabled` directory:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.team /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

#### b. **Check Nginx Configuration Syntax**:
   Ensure there are no syntax errors in your Nginx configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

#### c. **Reload Nginx**:
   If there are no errors, reload Nginx to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### 3. **Verify DNS and Nginx Configuration**

#### a. **Check if DNS Has Propagated**:
   You can check if the DNS changes have propagated by running:
   ```bash
   nslookup omniversal.team
   ```

   This should return your server’s public IP address.

#### b. **Test Your Server**:
   In your browser, visit `http://omniversal.team` (or `www.omniversal.team` if you set that up). If everything is configured correctly, you should see the default Nginx page or the website you’ve placed in `/var/www/omniversal.team`.

### 4. **Set Up SSL (Optional, but Recommended)**

For a secure connection (HTTPS), you should install an SSL certificate. The easiest way to do this is by using Certbot, which integrates directly with Nginx.

- **Install Certbot**: If you haven’t installed it yet, you can follow the instructions I gave in the earlier message.
  
- **Run Certbot to Automatically Configure SSL**:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d omniversal.team -d www.omniversal.team
   ```
   Certbot will automatically create the necessary SSL certificates and update your Nginx configuration to use HTTPS.

### Conclusion

By updating the DNS records and configuring Nginx, you can point your domain to your server. The optional SSL step ensures that your website is served securely over HTTPS.

**ASSISTANT**: Pointing your domains towards your Nginx server involves several key steps:

---

### **1. Update Your DNS Records**
You need to configure your domain's DNS settings to point to your Nginx server's IP address. This is typically done through your domain registrar or DNS provider.

#### Steps:
1. **Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., DreamHost, GoDaddy, Namecheap).**
2. **Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.**
3. **Add or update an "A" Record**:
   - **Name**: Leave this blank or enter `@` to refer to the root domain (e.g., `example.com`).
   - **Type**: Select "A" Record.
   - **Value**: Enter your Nginx server's public IP address.
   - **TTL**: Use the default value (e.g., 3600 seconds).

4. **Add a "CNAME" Record** (optional, for subdomains like `www`):
   - **Name**: Enter `www`.
   - **Type**: CNAME.
   - **Value**: Enter your root domain (e.g., `example.com`).

#### Example:
| Type | Name | Value             | TTL  |
|------|------|-------------------|------|
| A    | @    | `123.456.789.012` | 3600 |
| CNAME| www  | `example.com`     | 3600 |

---

### **2. Configure Your Nginx Server**

#### 2.1. **Set Up a Server Block (Virtual Host)**
Nginx uses server blocks to manage multiple domains. Create or edit a configuration file for your domain.

1. Navigate to your Nginx configuration directory:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
   ```

2. Create a new configuration file for your domain:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
   ```

3. Add the following configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com www.example.com;

       root /var/www/example.com/html;
       index index.html index.htm;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

4. Create the root directory for your website files:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.com
   ```

5. Create a sample `index.html` file:
   ```bash
   echo "<h1>Welcome to example.com!</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
   ```

6. Enable the site by creating a symbolic link:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

7. Test the Nginx configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

8. Reload Nginx to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

---

### **3. Obtain and Configure an SSL Certificate (Optional but Recommended)**
Secure your domain with an SSL certificate using Certbot:

1. Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:
   (If not already installed, see the previous steps.)
   ```bash
   sudo snap install certbot --classic
   sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
   sudo snap install certbot-nginx
   ```

2. Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
   ```

3. Test automatic renewal:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

---

### **4. Verify DNS Propagation**
DNS changes may take a few minutes to several hours to propagate worldwide. Use tools like [What's My DNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check if your domain resolves to your server's IP address.

---

### **5. Access Your Domain**
Once DNS has propagated and Nginx is configured, access your domain in a browser:
- Visit `http://example.com` (or `https://example.com` if SSL is configured).

**USER**: how do I find my server's ip address?


**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Finding your server's IP address depends on whether you need the **public** or **private** IP address. Here’s how to find both:

---

### **1. Find the Public IP Address (Internet-facing IP)**

This is the IP address used to access your server from the internet.

#### a. **Using a Command in the Terminal**
   Run:
   ```bash
   curl ifconfig.me
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com
   ```

   This will display your public IP address.

#### b. **Using an Online Service**
   If you have a web browser on the server, visit any of these websites to find your public IP:
   - [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
   - [https://ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io)

#### c. **Check Router Settings**
   If your server is behind a router (e.g., in a home or office network), you can log in to your router’s admin panel to find the public IP address. Look for "WAN IP" or "Internet IP" in the router's settings.

---

### **2. Find the Private IP Address (Local Network IP)**

This is the IP address used within your local network.

#### a. **Using the `ip` Command**
   Run:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ```
   Look for the `inet` field under the network interface you're using (e.g., `eth0`, `ens33`, `wlan0`). It will look something like this:
   ```
   inet 192.168.1.100/24
   ```
   - `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x` is a private IP.

#### b. **Using `hostname` Command**
   Run:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
   This will display all IP addresses assigned to your server (public and private).

#### c. **Using `ifconfig` (Older Systems)**
   If the `ip` command isn't available, you can use:
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   Look for `inet` under the relevant network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).

---

### **3. Identify the Correct IP for Your Nginx Server**

- **Public IP**: Use this if you're setting up a domain accessible from the internet.
- **Private IP**: Use this if your server is behind a NAT (e.g., home network or office) and you’re accessing it locally.

Let me know if you need help with interpreting the results!

**USER**: can't install remi-8.1


**ASSISTANT**: If you're encountering issues installing `remi-8.1` (likely referring to the Remi repository for PHP 8.1), it could be due to repository configuration, compatibility issues, or missing dependencies. Here's how to resolve this step-by-step:

---

### **1. Ensure You Have `dnf` Installed and Updated**

Run the following commands to update your system and make sure `dnf` is properly configured:
```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

---

### **2. Install the `epel-release` Repository**

The Remi repository often depends on the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository. Install it:
```bash
sudo dnf install epel-release -y
sudo dnf update -y
```

---

### **3. Install the Remi Repository**

Install the Remi repository using the official package:
```bash
sudo dnf install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm -y
```

This installs the Remi repository for RHEL 8 (or derivatives like CentOS Stream, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, etc.).

---

### **4. Enable the PHP 8.1 Module**

Once the Remi repository is installed, you need to enable the correct module for PHP 8.1:
```bash
sudo dnf module reset php -y
sudo dnf module enable php:remi-8.1 -y
```

---

### **5. Install PHP 8.1**

Install PHP 8.1 and any necessary extensions:
```bash
sudo dnf install php php-cli php-fpm php-mysqlnd php-opcache php-xml php-gd php-mbstring php-json php-curl -y
```

You can adjust the extensions based on your requirements.

---

### **6. Verify the Installation**

Check the installed PHP version to confirm it's 8.1:
```bash
php -v
```

---

### **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**

1. **Error: Cannot Install Remi Repository**
   - Ensure you're using an OS compatible with the repository (RHEL 8, CentOS 8 Stream, AlmaLinux 8, Rocky Linux 8, etc.).
   - If you're using an older version (e.g., RHEL 7), use the Remi repository for that version:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm -y
     ```

2. **Error: Repository Not Found**
   - Check your internet connection and ensure the system can access external URLs.

3. **Conflicts with Existing PHP Versions**
   - Remove any existing PHP installations before enabling the Remi module:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf remove php* -y
     ```

4. **Remi Not Enabled**
   - Ensure the Remi repository is enabled:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf repolist
     ```
   - If not enabled, enable it manually:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled remi
     ```

---

If the issue persists, share the error message you're encountering, and I can provide a more targeted solution!

**USER**: [selene@omniversal ~]$ 
sudo dnf module install php:remi-9.4-2 -y
sudo systemctl restart httpd
Last metadata expiration check: 0:01:48 ago on Fri 22 Nov 2024 09:09:43 PM EST.
Error: Problems in request:
missing groups or modules: php:remi-9.4-2
Job for httpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status httpd.service" and "journalctl -xeu httpd.service" for details.


**ASSISTANT**: The error indicates two issues:

1. **PHP Module Issue**: The `php:remi-9.4-2` module is not available.
2. **Apache (httpd) Issue**: Apache failed to restart, likely due to a configuration or module compatibility issue.

### **Resolving the PHP Module Issue**

The module name `php:remi-9.4-2` seems incorrect or unavailable. To find the correct PHP version, list the available modules:

```bash
sudo dnf module list php
```

This will display all available PHP streams. Look for the Remi version (e.g., `remi-8.1`, `remi-9.4`, etc.) and enable it. For example:

```bash
sudo dnf module reset php -y
sudo dnf module enable php:remi-8.1 -y
```

Then, install PHP and its extensions:

```bash
sudo dnf install php php-cli php-fpm -y
```

---

### **Fixing Apache (`httpd`)**

1. **Check Apache Status**

Run:
```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

The output will indicate why the service failed. Common issues include:

- Missing PHP modules
- Configuration syntax errors
- Port conflicts

2. **Check Logs for Details**

Use the following commands to examine the logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -xeu httpd.service
sudo cat /var/log/httpd/error_log
```

Look for errors like:
- `Module not found`
- `Permission denied`
- `Port already in use`

3. **Fix Missing PHP Module in Apache**

Ensure the PHP module is installed and enabled:
```bash
sudo dnf install php php-fpm php-common php-mysqlnd -y
```

Restart PHP-FPM and Apache:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable php-fpm --now
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

4. **Test Apache Configuration**

Check for configuration syntax issues:
```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
```

If there are errors, fix the mentioned lines in the configuration files, typically in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/`.

5. **Check SELinux or Firewall**

If SELinux is enabled, ensure Apache can serve content:
```bash
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
sudo setsebool -P httpd_execmem on
```

For the firewall, open the necessary ports:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### **Test Everything**

1. Restart all services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

2. Verify services are running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status php-fpm
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```

3. Test your server by visiting its IP or domain in a browser.

If issues persist, share the output of:
- `sudo systemctl status httpd`
- `sudo journalctl -xeu httpd.service`

**ASSISTANT**: The error `(98)Address already in use` indicates that another service is already using the same port Apache is configured to use (usually port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS). Here’s how to resolve the issue:

---

### **Steps to Fix:**

#### 1. **Check What is Using the Port**

Find the process using port 80 or 443:
```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo lsof -i :443
```

This will show which processes are using those ports. The output should look something like this:
```
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
nginx    1234   root   6u  IPv4 123456      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)
```

#### 2. **Stop the Conflicting Service**

If another service (e.g., Nginx) is using the port, stop it:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

You can also disable it if you don’t need it:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

#### 3. **Restart Apache**

After stopping the conflicting service, restart Apache:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Check its status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

#### 4. **Reconfigure Apache to Use a Different Port (Optional)**

If you cannot stop the conflicting service, you can configure Apache to use a different port.

- Open the Apache configuration file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  ```

- Find the line starting with `Listen` and change it from:
  ```bash
  Listen 80
  ```
  to another port, e.g.:
  ```bash
  Listen 8080
  ```

- Save and close the file, then restart Apache:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart httpd
  ```

You will now need to access your server via `http://your-domain:8080`.

#### 5. **Ensure Apache Can Open Logs**

The error `AH00015: Unable to open logs` may indicate a permissions issue. Fix this by ensuring the Apache log directory exists and is writable:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/httpd
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/log/httpd
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/log/httpd
```

Restart Apache again:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

---

### **Verification**

- After resolving the issue, verify that Apache is running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status httpd
  ```

- Test by accessing your server's IP or domain in a browser.

If the issue persists, share the output of `sudo lsof -i :80` and `sudo lsof -i :443` for further troubleshooting.

httpd   75923 apache    6u  IPv6 241403      0t0  TCP *:https (LISTEN)


**ASSISTANT**: From the output, we can see:

1. **Port 80**: Not listed, so it's not in use by any service. If Apache is configured to listen on port 80, it should work without issues.
2. **Port 443**: Apache (`httpd`) is actively listening on port 443 (`https`). This suggests that the issue might not be with port conflicts but rather with the Apache configuration or another related issue.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

#### **1. Check Apache Error Logs**
Apache might be failing due to a configuration issue unrelated to ports. Check the error logs for more detailed information:
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/httpd/error_log
```

Look for lines that indicate:
- Syntax errors in configuration files
- Missing or invalid SSL certificates
- Module or file permission issues

#### **2. Verify SSL Certificate Configuration**
If Apache is listening on port 443, ensure your SSL certificate is valid and correctly configured in the Apache configuration files. Check the Virtual Host configuration for SSL in `/etc/httpd/conf.d` or `/etc/httpd/sites-available`.

Example SSL Virtual Host block:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/your-domain

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/your-domain.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/your-domain.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/your-chain.pem

    <Directory "/var/www/your-domain">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Restart Apache after verifying:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

#### **3. Ensure Apache Modules Are Enabled**
Verify that required modules for SSL and PHP are enabled:
```bash
sudo dnf install mod_ssl
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

#### **4. Validate Apache Configuration**
Check for configuration syntax errors:
```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
```

If there are issues, fix them as suggested in the output.

#### **5. Test Apache on Both Ports**
Check that Apache is correctly serving requests:
- **Port 80 (HTTP)**:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://your-domain.com
   ```
- **Port 443 (HTTPS)**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-domain.com
   ```

#### **6. Monitor Apache Logs**
While restarting Apache, monitor logs for live errors:
```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u httpd
```

### If Issues Persist:
- Share the output of the following commands:
  ```bash
  sudo apachectl configtest
  sudo cat /var/log/httpd/error_log | tail -n 20
  ```
- This will provide more insight into what’s causing Apache to fail.

**USER**: What does this step in your RHEL Server setup instructions mean - Can you elaborate?

1. Set Up File Storage

To host resources for Omniversal.cloud, you can create dedicated directories under /var/www/omniversal.cloud/.


**ASSISTANT**: The step to "Set Up File Storage" is about organizing and preparing your server's file structure to host and manage the resources for your `Omniversal.cloud` project. Here's a detailed explanation of what this involves and why it matters:

---

### **1. Why Create Dedicated Directories?**
When hosting a website or application on a server, it’s crucial to have a clear and organized file structure. Using dedicated directories ensures:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each project or domain has its own space, avoiding conflicts between resources for different sites or services.
- **Security**: Limiting access to specific directories reduces the risk of exposing sensitive files.
- **Ease of Management**: Simplifies updates, backups, and debugging.

For `Omniversal.cloud`, you’ll create a root directory (e.g., `/var/www/omniversal.cloud/`) to store all files and subdirectories specific to this site.

---

### **2. What Files Will Be Stored Here?**
The `/var/www/omniversal.cloud/` directory will typically contain:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript Files**: If your site has a static front end.
- **Dynamic Content (e.g., PHP Files)**: If you’re using server-side scripting.
- **Media Files**: Images, videos, PDFs, or any other assets served to users.
- **Configuration Files**: Custom `.htaccess` rules, `.env` files, or site-specific configuration data.
- **Logs or Temp Files**: Depending on your app's needs (though logs are better stored elsewhere for security).

---

### **3. How to Create and Configure the Directory**
Here's how you can set up and secure this directory:

#### a. **Create the Directory**
Run the following command to create the directory:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/omniversal.cloud
```

#### b. **Set Permissions**
To ensure your web server (Apache or Nginx) can read and serve files from this directory:
```bash
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/omniversal.cloud
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/omniversal.cloud
```

#### c. **Add Subdirectories (Optional)**
You may want to organize resources into subdirectories. For example:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/omniversal.cloud/{html,assets,logs,config}
```
- `html`: Store your main site files (e.g., `index.html`, `app.php`).
- `assets`: Store images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- `logs`: A dedicated place for site-specific logs.
- `config`: For configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `settings.php`).

#### d. **Upload Your Content**
Use `scp`, `rsync`, or SFTP to upload your website files to the `html` folder:
```bash
scp -r local_folder/ user@your_server:/var/www/omniversal.cloud/html/
```

---

### **4. Update Your Web Server Configuration**
Once the directory is set up, tell your web server to use it as the document root for `Omniversal.cloud`.

#### For Apache
Edit or create a virtual host configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/omniversal.cloud.conf
```

Example configuration:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName omniversal.cloud
    DocumentRoot /var/www/omniversal.cloud/html

    <Directory /var/www/omniversal.cloud/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog /var/www/omniversal.cloud/logs/error.log
    CustomLog /var/www/omniversal.cloud/logs/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Save the file, then reload Apache:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

#### For Nginx
Edit the configuration file for your site:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/omniversal.cloud.conf
```

Example configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name omniversal.cloud;

    root /var/www/omniversal.cloud/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    error_log /var/www/omniversal.cloud/logs/error.log;
    access_log /var/www/omniversal.cloud/logs/access.log;
}
```

Save the file, then reload Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

### **5. Test Your Setup**
- Visit `http://omniversal.cloud` in your browser.
- Ensure the server correctly serves your site files from `/var/www/omniversal.cloud/html`.

---

### **Summary**
This step prepares your server to host your website or application in an organized and secure way. By creating dedicated directories under `/var/www/omniversal.cloud/`, you ensure your server is ready to handle the resources for `Omniversal.cloud` while maintaining a logical structure for easy management.
