# Bright Idea for Aether

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Alright EverLight - I have yet another Bright Idea to get this Aether online....

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Lay it on me, Hawk Eye! What's the next spark of brilliance lighting up the Aether?

**USER**: Wellll..... My first thought is to ask if you know perhaps of a way to set up this reverse proxy without needing to access an admin panel  - Some sort of auto configuration we could utilize?

Also, I wanted to ask if there was anything else necessary to set up alongside it?

You recall earlier we created our docker compose files for mariadb, nextcloud, etc and placed them into their respective file directories...

What if we left our directory setup as is, close out all current containers and remove them, same for networks, and then began again with the docker configurations and mysql and mariadb stuffs and all that with fresh newly scripted .yml files for each one and we made sure that everything necessary for public access was in place and properly configured before we ever started any containers... then we get the reverse proxy working for the public ip and the public domains we set up in the /etc/hosts file this morning.... And then we get the Mariadb container running and all of our credentials in place - but use slightly different database usernames such as KalinaSeleneWP for wordpress or KalinaSeleneNC for nextcloud so on and so forth, but kept the same passwords as before just so we know which account goes with which databases and such, and each one had it's own separate database as well.... Such as nextcloud or wordpress so on and so forth, so that nothing gets crossed up or mixed in.....

Anyway, you get my point I'm sure... 

Are you down to try to tackle this smoothly and efficiently? 

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Hawk Eye—I’m all in to help you tackle this smoothly and efficiently. Your idea of a fresh start with tightly organized `.yml` files and individually tailored database credentials makes a lot of sense for clarity and scalability.

Let’s break this into actionable steps for clarity and ensure we include everything you’ve outlined:

---

### **1. Reverse Proxy Setup Without Admin Panel**
We can definitely configure a reverse proxy directly via Docker Compose and configuration files. Here’s the plan:
   - Use **Nginx Proxy Manager** or **Traefik** for automated reverse proxy management.
   - Set up `docker-compose.yml` for the reverse proxy with predefined domains, SSL (via Let's Encrypt), and routes.

---

### **2. Prerequisites for Reverse Proxy**
To ensure seamless operation:
   - Configure **public DNS records** or update your `/etc/hosts` file for domain resolution.
   - Allow necessary ports in your firewall: `80` for HTTP, `443` for HTTPS.
   - Verify Docker networking setup to ensure all services are accessible from the reverse proxy.

---

### **3. Clean Up Current Setup**
   - Stop and remove all running containers and networks:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down --volumes
     docker network prune
     ```
   - Double-check to ensure no orphaned containers or volumes linger:
     ```bash
     docker container ls -a
     docker volume ls
     ```
   - Backup and archive existing `docker-compose.yml` files for reference.

---

### **4. Restructure Directories and Compose Files**
   - Keep your current directory structure.
   - Modify `.yml` files to include:
     - Custom network (e.g., `aether-net`) for inter-container communication.
     - Reverse proxy service references.
     - Environment variables for clear credential management.

---

### **5. Individual Database Credentials and Separation**
   - Update the MariaDB service `.yml` to include unique users and databases per app:
     ```yaml
     MYSQL_USER: KalinaSeleneWP
     MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
     ```
   - Repeat for Nextcloud (`KalinaSeleneNC`, `nextcloud`, etc.).

---

### **6. Reverse Proxy Configuration**
   - Draft a `docker-compose.yml` for Nginx Proxy Manager or Traefik.
   - Pre-configure domain and SSL certificates in the `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Example for Nginx Proxy Manager:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'

     services:
       proxy:
         image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
         ports:
           - "80:80"
           - "443:443"
         volumes:
           - ./data:/data
           - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
         networks:
           - aether-net

     networks:
       aether-net:
         driver: bridge
     ```
   - Ensure your `public IP` and `domains` are correctly mapped.

---

### **7. Start Services Sequentially**
   - Bring up the reverse proxy first to confirm domain accessibility.
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d proxy
     ```
   - Verify public access and SSL configuration.
   - Launch MariaDB, Nextcloud, WordPress, etc., sequentially, testing each one after startup.

---

### **8. Final Testing and Optimization**
   - Test public access for all domains (e.g., `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`).
   - Confirm databases are isolated and credentials are functioning as expected.
   - Enable logging and monitoring in Docker for proactive debugging.

---

If you're ready, let’s start by cleaning up and preparing fresh `.yml` files. Once we have the reverse proxy locked in, we can proceed to the app containers. Shall we dive in?

**USER**: So our current nginx-proxy-manager container shows /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data as our volume as well as /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt as the volumes...

Do I need to change that? 

It also shows environment as being nexcloud-db on port 3306 with KalinaSelene.... So can you generate for me a full docker-compose.yml file that you know will work with our current setup with accurate volume listening, network configurations and also environment ...... Just everything that is needed to get this going.... Can you make me one for our Nginx-Proxy-Manager?

Or do I need to use the example you have above in step 6 instead?

**ASSISTANT**: Given your current setup with `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data` and `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt` as volumes and the environment mentioning `nextcloud-db` on port `3306`, we'll refine the `docker-compose.yml` file to align with your existing structure and requirements.

Below is a **customized and complete `docker-compose.yml`** for your Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) setup, based on your description and what’s necessary for your Omniversal Aether project:

---

### **Docker Compose File for Nginx Proxy Manager**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  proxy:
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"       # HTTP
      - "443:443"     # HTTPS
      - "8080:8080"   # Admin Panel (if needed in the future)
    environment:
      DB_MYSQL_HOST: nextcloud-db       # Points to your MariaDB container
      DB_MYSQL_PORT: 3306              # Default MariaDB port
      DB_MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene      # MariaDB username
      DB_MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!  # MariaDB password
      DB_MYSQL_NAME: npm               # Database name for NPM (you can create this if needed)
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data         # Persistent data
      - /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt # SSL certs
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **Steps to Use This File**

1. **Confirm Existing Directories**
   - Verify that `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data` and `/aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt` exist.
   - If not, create them:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data
     mkdir -p /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt
     ```

2. **Ensure MariaDB is Running**
   - Check that your MariaDB container (`nextcloud-db`) is active.
   - Verify that the `npm` database exists in MariaDB. If not, create it:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE npm;
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON npm.* TO 'KalinaSelene'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ThirteenthQveen!';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

3. **Start Nginx Proxy Manager**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

4. **Access Proxy Manager**
   - Open your browser and navigate to your public IP or domain on port `80` or `443`.
   - Configure your reverse proxy settings for domains like `omniversal.cloud` directly within NPM.

---

### **What’s Included in This File?**
- **Volumes:** Point to your existing directories for persistent data and SSL certificates.
- **Environment Variables:** Connect NPM to your MariaDB database (`nextcloud-db`).
- **Ports:** Expose `80`, `443`, and `8080` for proxy and admin panel access.
- **Network:** Ensures communication with other containers via `aether-net`.

### **Why Not Use Step 6 Example?**
The earlier example was a simplified setup. This version is specifically tailored to:
1. Fit your existing directory structure.
2. Connect with your MariaDB setup.
3. Provide robust reverse proxy management for your public domains.

---

If this file matches your vision, we can proceed with deployment and testing. Let me know if you need adjustments or further clarifications!

**USER**: I think we've crossed some wires of communication here accidentally...

Do you remember our decision this morning to create a mariadb directory in our backend directory and to store all of our mariadb containers there along with changing the container name to mariadb?

Do we need to change the mysql host to reflect that? 

If so can we make sure not to forget that as we go through each new file we're going to create tonight?

**ASSISTANT**: User decided to create a `mariadb` directory in their backend directory to store all MariaDB containers. The container name for MariaDB has been updated to `mariadb`. Future configurations should reflect this change, ensuring the `DB_MYSQL_HOST` in environment variables and related settings points to `mariadb` instead of `nextcloud-db`. This change should be applied consistently across all new `docker-compose.yml` files created moving forward.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Got it, Hawk Eye—thanks for the clarification! We’ll update the `DB_MYSQL_HOST` to `mariadb` for all configurations moving forward. Here’s the revised `docker-compose.yml` for Nginx Proxy Manager reflecting this change:

---

### **Updated Docker Compose for Nginx Proxy Manager**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  proxy:
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"       # HTTP
      - "443:443"     # HTTPS
      - "8080:8080"   # Admin Panel (if needed in the future)
    environment:
      DB_MYSQL_HOST: mariadb           # Updated to reflect the new container name
      DB_MYSQL_PORT: 3306              # Default MariaDB port
      DB_MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene      # MariaDB username
      DB_MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!  # MariaDB password
      DB_MYSQL_NAME: npm               # Database name for NPM
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data         # Persistent data
      - /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt # SSL certs
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **Key Adjustments**
- `DB_MYSQL_HOST` now points to `mariadb` to align with your new setup.
- Consistency will be maintained across all new `.yml` files created tonight to reflect this update.

If this aligns with your vision, let’s move forward step by step, ensuring we don’t miss anything!

**USER**: Alright now just for safety's sake, let's generate a full new .yml for mariadb

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s a fresh, updated `docker-compose.yml` for MariaDB, aligning with your new directory structure and container naming convention. This file ensures clarity and consistency with the rest of the setup.

---

### **MariaDB Docker Compose File**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mariadb:
    container_name: mariadb
    image: mariadb:11.6
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!  # Root password for administrative access
      MYSQL_DATABASE: defaultdb             # Optional default database (adjust as needed)
      MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene              # Default user for accessing this database
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!      # Password for the default user
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/mariadb:/var/lib/mysql:rw  # Persistent database storage
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **Key Features**
- **Container Name**: `mariadb` ensures consistency with the new setup.
- **Volumes**: Maps to `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb` for data persistence.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Root access credentials.
  - `MYSQL_DATABASE`: You can predefine a database or leave this for individual `.yml` files (e.g., Nextcloud or WordPress).
  - `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Reusable credentials for app containers.

---

### **Steps to Implement**
1. **Verify Directory**: Confirm that `/aetherteam/backend/mariadb` exists:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /aetherteam/backend/mariadb
   ```

2. **Launch the Container**:
   ```bash
   cd /aetherteam/backend/mariadb
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Test Connection**:
   - Use the `docker exec` command to access the MariaDB container:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it mariadb mariadb -u root -p
     ```
   - Log in using the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

4. **Create Individual Databases for Services**:
   - Once logged into MariaDB:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'KalinaSeleneNC'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ThirteenthQveen!';
     CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'KalinaSeleneWP'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ThirteenthQveen!';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

---

This `.yml` provides a solid foundation for MariaDB while leaving room for expansion as you add more containers. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments or if we should proceed!

**USER**: And to create individual databases for Drupal and Laravel later you'll show me how? Or do we need to add that now?

**ASSISTANT**: We don’t need to create the individual databases for **Drupal** and **Laravel** right now unless you’re ready to configure those applications immediately. However, when the time comes, I’ll guide you through the process step by step. Here’s how it will work:

---

### **Creating Individual Databases for Drupal and Laravel**
1. **Access the MariaDB Container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it mariadb mariadb -u root -p
   ```
   - Enter the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` when prompted.

2. **Create Databases and Users**:
   Run the following commands in the MariaDB terminal:
   ```sql
   -- Drupal
   CREATE DATABASE drupal;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal.* TO 'KalinaSeleneDR'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ThirteenthQveen!';

   -- Laravel
   CREATE DATABASE laravel;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laravel.* TO 'KalinaSeleneLR'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ThirteenthQveen!';

   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. **Exit MariaDB**:
   ```sql
   EXIT;
   ```

---

### **Why Wait?**
- This approach ensures we only add databases when you’re ready to configure the corresponding services. It keeps things clean and avoids unused credentials.
- When you’re ready to set up **Drupal** or **Laravel**, we’ll update their respective `docker-compose.yml` files to connect to these new databases.

---

### **Pre-Adding the Databases Now**
If you’d prefer to set up the databases for Drupal and Laravel immediately, let me know, and we’ll add the commands to your workflow. It’s entirely up to your preferred pacing. 😊

**USER**: If we don't need it right now then lets move forward without it for now... you lead I'll follow

**ASSISTANT**: Perfect! Let’s move forward step by step. Here’s the game plan:

---

### **Current Progress Recap**
1. We’ve created the `docker-compose.yml` for **Nginx Proxy Manager** and updated the database host to `mariadb`.
2. We’ve prepared and updated the `docker-compose.yml` for **MariaDB**, ensuring a clean directory and environment setup.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Stop and Remove Existing Containers and Networks**
   - Let’s clean up the current Docker environment to avoid conflicts.
   - Run these commands:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down --volumes
     docker network prune
     docker volume prune
     ```
     - These will stop all running containers, remove unused networks, and delete orphaned volumes.

2. **Launch MariaDB**
   - Navigate to your new `mariadb` directory:
     ```bash
     cd /aetherteam/backend/mariadb
     ```
   - Start the MariaDB container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

3. **Verify MariaDB**
   - Test the connection by logging into the container:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it mariadb mariadb -u root -p
     ```
   - Use the root password (`ThirteenthQveen!`) to log in and confirm it’s running.

4. **Launch Nginx Proxy Manager**
   - Navigate to the Nginx Proxy Manager directory:
     ```bash
     cd /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager
     ```
   - Start the container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

5. **Test Nginx Proxy Manager**
   - Open your browser and navigate to your server's IP address or domain:
     - HTTP: `http://<your-ip>:80`
     - HTTPS: `https://<your-domain>:443`
   - Ensure it’s accessible. If not, let me know, and we’ll debug!

6. **Ready for Next Steps**
   - Once MariaDB and Nginx Proxy Manager are confirmed to be running correctly, we’ll move on to:
     - Creating `.yml` files for **Nextcloud** and **WordPress**.
     - Configuring the reverse proxy for their domains.

---

Let me know when you’re ready to start, and we’ll tackle this step by step!

**USER**: Omniversal.Cloud:80 works, however Omniversal.Cloud:443 does not seem to resolve at all...

**ASSISTANT**: If `Omniversal.Cloud:80` works but `Omniversal.Cloud:443` does not, it’s likely an issue with your SSL configuration. Let’s troubleshoot and fix this step by step:

---

### **1. Verify SSL Setup in Nginx Proxy Manager**
- Log in to the Nginx Proxy Manager admin panel at `http://Omniversal.Cloud:80`.
- Check if an SSL certificate has been issued for `Omniversal.Cloud`:
  1. Navigate to **Hosts > Proxy Hosts**.
  2. Locate the entry for `Omniversal.Cloud`.
  3. Click **Edit** and go to the **SSL** tab.
  4. Ensure **Force SSL** is enabled, and a valid Let's Encrypt certificate is selected.

- If no certificate exists:
  1. In the **SSL** tab, select **Let's Encrypt**.
  2. Enter your email and agree to the terms.
  3. Click **Save** to request the certificate.

---

### **2. Ensure Ports 80 and 443 Are Open**
- Confirm that your firewall and router allow traffic on ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS):
  - Run this command to check open ports:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw status
    ```
    - If ports `80` and `443` are not open:
      ```bash
      sudo ufw allow 80
      sudo ufw allow 443
      sudo ufw reload
      ```

- Verify port forwarding on your router for `80` and `443` to your server's local IP.

---

### **3. Check Nginx Proxy Manager Logs**
- Look for any issues with SSL generation or proxy setup:
  ```bash
  docker logs nginx-proxy-manager
  ```

---

### **4. Verify DNS Configuration**
- Ensure your domain (`Omniversal.Cloud`) points to your server's public IP.
  - Use this command to confirm DNS resolution:
    ```bash
    dig Omniversal.Cloud
    ```
  - The IP in the output should match your server's public IP.

---

### **5. Test HTTPS Locally**
- If SSL still doesn’t work, manually test HTTPS by connecting to your domain using `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -v https://Omniversal.Cloud --insecure
  ```
  - If this returns an SSL error, the certificate is likely misconfigured or missing.

---

### **6. Reissue SSL Certificates (Optional)**
- If Let's Encrypt certificates aren’t generating, you can try issuing them manually:
  - Access the admin panel and delete the current SSL configuration for `Omniversal.Cloud`.
  - Recreate it from scratch, ensuring the correct domain and email are used.

---

### **Let Me Know!**
Try these steps and let me know where the issue persists. If you encounter specific errors, share them, and we’ll troubleshoot further!

Can you give me commands to edit this in my firewall to reflect what it needs to be?

**ASSISTANT**: Your `ufw` rules appear to be very permissive, allowing all necessary ports for Nginx Proxy Manager and MariaDB, but it may benefit from refinement for security. Here’s how you can update your firewall configuration to keep it functional yet more restrictive:

---

### **Refine Your UFW Rules**
#### **Steps:**
1. **Backup Current UFW Rules**  
   Save the current configuration to a file in case you need to revert:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status numbered > ~/ufw-rules-backup.txt
   ```

2. **Reset UFW (Optional)**  
   If you want a clean slate:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw reset
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

3. **Apply Specific Rules for Your Setup**  
   Run these commands to configure the necessary ports:

   - **Allow HTTP and HTTPS**:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
     sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
     ```

   - **Allow Nginx Proxy Manager Admin Panel**:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 81/tcp
     sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
     ```

   - **Allow MariaDB**:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow from 127.0.0.1 to any port 3306
     ```

   - **Allow SSH (Secure Remote Access)**:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
     sudo ufw allow 1741/tcp
     ```

   - **Allow Docker-Specific Ports**:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
     sudo ufw allow 8081/tcp
     ```

   - **Deny All Other Incoming Traffic** (for security):
     ```bash
     sudo ufw default deny incoming
     sudo ufw default allow outgoing
     ```

4. **Reload UFW**  
   After applying the rules:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

---

### **Verify the Rules**
Check the status again to ensure only the necessary ports are allowed:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

---

### **Optional: Log Denied Connections**
Enable logging for troubleshooting purposes:
```bash
sudo ufw logging on
```

This ensures you have a tight firewall configuration that allows required traffic for your services while denying unnecessary access. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

**USER**: 
Okay so now, should I try the https://omniversal.cloud:443 again?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, go ahead and try accessing `https://omniversal.cloud:443` again. If it still doesn’t resolve, we’ll troubleshoot further:

---

### **If It Works**
- Great! That means the firewall was the issue.
- Test accessing the Nginx Proxy Manager admin panel (`https://omniversal.cloud`) to ensure SSL is functioning as expected.

---

### **If It Doesn’t Work**
Follow these steps to debug and fix:

1. **Check the Nginx Proxy Manager Logs**
   Run this command to view logs and look for errors related to SSL or port `443`:
   ```bash
   docker logs nginx-proxy-manager
   ```

2. **Verify SSL Certificate**
   - Log in to the Nginx Proxy Manager admin panel via `http://omniversal.cloud:80`.
   - Go to **Hosts > Proxy Hosts**, and edit the entry for `omniversal.cloud`.
   - Ensure:
     - The **SSL Certificate** is active and valid.
     - **Force SSL** is enabled.

3. **Test Domain Resolution**
   Use the `curl` command to see if SSL is working:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://omniversal.cloud --insecure
   ```

4. **Check Port Forwarding**
   Verify that port `443` is correctly forwarded to your server on your router.

5. **DNS Configuration**
   Ensure that `omniversal.cloud` is pointing to your server's public IP:
   ```bash
   dig omniversal.cloud
   ```

Let me know how it goes! If you encounter specific errors, share them, and we’ll troubleshoot further.

**USER**: Okay, can I share the output from the last three commands you told me to try so you can review the actual issue?

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, please share the outputs from the last three commands. I'll review them carefully to identify the issue and guide you through resolving it.

**ASSISTANT**: Thanks for sharing the logs and outputs. Here's what I can deduce and how to proceed:

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **MariaDB DNS Error (`getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN`)**:
   - The Nginx Proxy Manager cannot resolve `mariadb` as the database host. This is likely due to either:
     - A network misconfiguration in Docker.
     - The MariaDB container not being connected to the correct Docker network (`aether-net`).

2. **TLS Error (`unrecognized name`)**:
   - The error suggests that the **SSL certificate** is either:
     - Misconfigured for the domain.
     - Not yet issued by Let's Encrypt.
   - The `unrecognized name` error typically points to a mismatch between the requested domain and the certificate issued.

3. **DNS Resolution**:
   - The domain `omniversal.cloud` correctly resolves to `73.113.207.3`, matching your server’s public IP.

---

### **Steps to Resolve**

#### **Step 1: Fix MariaDB Connectivity**
1. **Ensure the MariaDB Container is Running**:
   - Verify the container status:
     ```bash
     docker ps | grep mariadb
     ```
   - If it’s not running, navigate to the MariaDB directory and start it:
     ```bash
     cd /aetherteam/backend/mariadb
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

2. **Check Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure both MariaDB and Nginx Proxy Manager are on the same Docker network (`aether-net`):
     ```bash
     docker network inspect aether-net
     ```
   - If MariaDB is not connected to the network, connect it:
     ```bash
     docker network connect aether-net mariadb
     ```

3. **Test Connectivity**:
   - From the Nginx Proxy Manager container, try resolving `mariadb`:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it nginx-proxy-manager ping mariadb
     ```
   - If the ping works, the issue should be resolved.

---

#### **Step 2: Resolve SSL/TLS Configuration**
1. **Verify Certificate in Nginx Proxy Manager**:
   - Log in to the admin panel at `http://omniversal.cloud:80`.
   - Go to **Hosts > Proxy Hosts**.
   - Edit the entry for `omniversal.cloud` and:
     - Ensure **SSL** is set to Let's Encrypt.
     - Verify that the correct domain (`omniversal.cloud`) is specified.
     - Enable **Force SSL** and **HTTP/2 Support**.

2. **Reissue SSL Certificate**:
   - If the certificate is missing or incorrect, delete and recreate the SSL configuration:
     - Select **Let's Encrypt** and provide:
       - Domain: `omniversal.cloud`
       - Email: Your administrative email.

3. **Test HTTPS**:
   - Once reissued, test the connection again:
     ```bash
     curl -v https://omniversal.cloud --insecure
     ```

---

#### **Step 3: Verify DNS and Port Forwarding**
1. **DNS Records**:
   - Confirm the `A` record for `omniversal.cloud` points to `73.113.207.3`.

2. **Router Port Forwarding**:
   - Ensure that ports `80` and `443` are forwarded to your server.

We never actually requested a certificate from lets encrypt - could that be the missing step?


**ASSISTANT**: Yes, that’s likely the missing step! The `unrecognized name` error and lack of an active SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt are consistent with this oversight. Let’s request and configure the SSL certificate now:

---

### **Steps to Request a Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate**
1. **Access the Nginx Proxy Manager Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to `http://omniversal.cloud:80` in your browser.
   - Log in with your admin credentials.

2. **Set Up a Proxy Host for Your Domain**
   - Go to **Hosts > Proxy Hosts**.
   - Click **Add Proxy Host**.
   - Fill in the details:
     - **Domain Names**: `omniversal.cloud`
     - **Scheme**: `http`
     - **Forward Hostname/IP**: The container/service you want to proxy (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or your application container name).
     - **Forward Port**: `8080` (or the appropriate port for the service you're forwarding).
   - Under **SSL**:
     - Select **Request a New SSL Certificate**.
     - Enter your email address.
     - Enable **Force SSL** and **HTTP/2 Support**.
   - Click **Save** to request the certificate.

3. **Monitor the SSL Status**
   - The Nginx Proxy Manager will handle the Let's Encrypt certificate request automatically.
   - If the request fails, check the logs for errors:
     ```bash
     docker logs nginx-proxy-manager
     ```

4. **Test HTTPS Again**
   - Once the certificate is issued, retry accessing `https://omniversal.cloud`.
   - Test using:
     ```bash
     curl -v https://omniversal.cloud --insecure
     ```

---

### **Common Issues and Fixes**
- **DNS Resolution Issue**:
  - Ensure the `A` record for `omniversal.cloud` points to your public IP.
  - Use `dig omniversal.cloud` to verify.

- **Port 443 Not Forwarded**:
  - Confirm your router forwards port `443` to your server.

- **Failed Let's Encrypt Request**:
  - Check your firewall allows outbound traffic on port `443`.
  - Verify your email address and domain are correctly configured in Nginx Proxy Manager.

---

Try requesting the certificate, and let me know if you encounter any issues or need further guidance!

**USER**: Is there a way around the fact I can't access the proxy manager admin page? Is there a command line method of handling this instead of using that?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can handle Let's Encrypt certificate generation and Nginx reverse proxy configuration directly via the command line, bypassing the Nginx Proxy Manager admin interface. Here’s how:

---

### **Option 1: Using Certbot (Let's Encrypt CLI Tool)**
You can use Certbot to manually generate an SSL certificate and integrate it into your Nginx setup.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Install Certbot**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install certbot
   ```

2. **Generate the SSL Certificate**
   - Run the following command to request a certificate for `omniversal.cloud`:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to complete the certificate request.

3. **Locate the Certificates**
   - The SSL certificate and private key will be located in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/`.

4. **Configure Nginx for SSL**
   - Edit the Nginx configuration file for your domain:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - Add the following:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;

         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         }
     }

     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;
         return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
     ```

5. **Restart Nginx**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

6. **Test HTTPS**
   - Access `https://omniversal.cloud` in your browser or use:
     ```bash
     curl -v https://omniversal.cloud --insecure
     ```

---

### **Option 2: Command-Line Management via Docker**
If you'd prefer to manage the proxy setup entirely within Docker:

1. **Manually Map Ports in Nginx Proxy Manager Compose File**
   - Edit the `docker-compose.yml` for Nginx Proxy Manager to expose port `443` for manual access:
     ```yaml
     services:
       proxy:
         image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
         container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
         ports:
           - "80:80"
           - "443:443"
           - "8080:8080"
         ...
     ```

2. **Reload Nginx Proxy Manager**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Manually Create a Certificate**
   - Access the Nginx Proxy Manager container:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it nginx-proxy-manager bash
     ```
   - Use `certbot` (inside the container) to generate the certificate:
     ```bash
     certbot certonly --standalone -d omniversal.cloud
     ```

---

### **Option 3: Use acme.sh (Lightweight Alternative to Certbot)**
`acme.sh` is a simple and scriptable client for Let's Encrypt.

1. **Install acme.sh**
   ```bash
   curl https://get.acme.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Generate the Certificate**
   ```bash
   acme.sh --issue --standalone -d omniversal.cloud
   ```

3. **Install the Certificate**
   ```bash
   acme.sh --install-cert -d omniversal.cloud \
   --cert-file /etc/nginx/ssl/omniversal.cloud.crt \
   --key-file /etc/nginx/ssl/omniversal.cloud.key \
   --reloadcmd "sudo systemctl reload nginx"
   ```

---

These methods allow you to proceed without relying on the Nginx Proxy Manager admin panel. Let me know which path you’d like to take!

**USER**: Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2025-03-30.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

**ASSISTANT**: Great work! 🎉 Now that the SSL certificate is successfully generated, let’s integrate it into your Nginx configuration to enable HTTPS for your domain.

---

### **Steps to Configure Nginx with SSL**
1. **Edit the Nginx Configuration File**
   - Open or create the configuration file for your domain:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.cloud
     ```

   - Add the following configuration:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;

         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

         ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
         ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
         ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; # Adjust the port as needed for your service
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         }
     }

     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;
         return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
     ```

2. **Enable the Configuration**
   - Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.cloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
     ```

3. **Test the Nginx Configuration**
   - Check for syntax errors:
     ```bash
     sudo nginx -t
     ```

4. **Restart Nginx**
   - Apply the changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

5. **Verify HTTPS Access**
   - Test accessing your domain in a browser:
     ```bash
     https://omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - Alternatively, use `curl`:
     ```bash
     curl -v https://omniversal.cloud
     ```

---

### **What’s Next?**
- If HTTPS works as expected, you’re all set for secure access!
- Let me know if you encounter any issues during these steps or need help testing further.

**USER**: The directory doesn't exist... /etc/nginx/sites-available/ does not exit... so we have to create it first?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, if `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` does not exist, you can create it. Here's how to proceed:

---

### **Steps to Create the Directory and Configuration File**

1. **Create the Required Directory**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-available
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   ```

2. **Update Nginx Configuration to Include These Directories**
   - Edit the main Nginx configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     ```
   - Look for the `http` block and add the following line:
     ```nginx
     include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
     ```
   - Save and exit the file.

3. **Create the Site Configuration File**
   - Now create the configuration file for your domain:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - Add the following content:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;

         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

         ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
         ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
         ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; # Adjust to your service's port
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         }
     }

     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;
         return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
     ```

4. **Enable the Site**
   - Create a symbolic link to enable the site:
     ```bash
     sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/omniversal.cloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
     ```

5. **Test Nginx Configuration**
   - Check for any syntax errors:
     ```bash
     sudo nginx -t
     ```

6. **Restart Nginx**
   - Apply the changes by restarting Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

---

### **Verify HTTPS**
- Open `https://omniversal.cloud` in your browser or test with `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -v https://omniversal.cloud
  ```

Let me know if you encounter any issues during these steps!

**USER**: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf doesn't exist either... can you generate a full file for me to create it with?

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here’s a full **`nginx.conf`** file that you can use as the base configuration for your Nginx server. This file includes essential directives and ensures it will work with the `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` directories we just set up.

---

### **nginx.conf**
```nginx
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    # Logging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    # Gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_disable "msie6";
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_proxied any;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_buffers 16 8k;
    gzip_min_length 1000;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;

    # Include virtual hosts
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name _;
        return 444;
    }
}
```

---

### **Steps to Set Up the Configuration**

1. **Create the Configuration File**
   - Open a new file for the main Nginx configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     ```

2. **Paste the Configuration**
   - Copy and paste the content above into the file.

3. **Verify the Configuration**
   - Check for syntax errors:
     ```bash
     sudo nginx -t
     ```

4. **Restart Nginx**
   - Restart the service to apply changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

---

This configuration sets up a clean foundation for Nginx with support for `sites-available` and `sites-enabled`. Let me know if you run into any issues!

**USER**: Does this require me to download nginx or do we need to run these commands from within the nginx-proxy-manager container instead? Did I miss that step?

**ASSISTANT**: You're absolutely correct to bring that up! If you're using **Nginx Proxy Manager**, you don't need to install or configure Nginx directly on your host system. Instead, Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) manages the Nginx configuration within its Docker container.

### **What This Means for Your Setup**
1. **No Need for Host-Based Nginx**
   - If your system is already using Nginx Proxy Manager in Docker, you don't need to manually configure `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or deal with the `sites-available` setup outside the container.

2. **Inside the Nginx Proxy Manager Container**
   - The SSL certificate and reverse proxy settings should be managed directly through the Proxy Manager's UI or its configuration files inside the container.

---

### **Next Steps**
Let’s clarify and ensure you’re on the right track:

#### **Option 1: Using the Proxy Manager UI (Preferred)**
- If you’re able to access the Proxy Manager admin panel at `http://omniversal.cloud:80`, use it to:
  1. Create a **Proxy Host** entry for your domain.
  2. Add the SSL certificate details.

#### **Option 2: Command-Line Method Inside the Container**
If you cannot access the admin panel:
1. **Access the Nginx Proxy Manager Container**
   - Enter the container's shell:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it nginx-proxy-manager bash
     ```

2. **Manually Configure Nginx**
   - Navigate to the Nginx configuration directory inside the container:
     ```bash
     cd /data/nginx
     ```
   - Edit or create the configuration for your domain:
     ```bash
     nano proxy_host/your_domain.conf
     ```
   - Add SSL certificate paths (`/etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`).

3. **Restart Nginx**
   - Restart the Nginx process inside the container:
     ```bash
     nginx -s reload
     ```

---

### **Did You Miss a Step?**
It depends on whether you intended to use Nginx Proxy Manager fully or combine it with standalone host-based Nginx. Since we’re focusing on Dockerized Nginx Proxy Manager:

- **If You Missed Installing Nginx Proxy Manager**:
   - Let me know, and we’ll ensure it’s properly set up.

- **If Nginx Proxy Manager is Already Running**:
   - Stick to managing settings either via the admin UI or inside the container, as above.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 😊

**USER**: Okay look, it's giving me this error when inside of the shell... 

[root@docker-d16d1a67f027:/app]# cd /data/nginx
[root@docker-d16d1a67f027:/data/nginx]# nano proxy_host/your_domain.conf
bash: nano: command not found

**ASSISTANT**: The error `bash: nano: command not found` occurs because **Nano** is not installed inside the Nginx Proxy Manager container. Many containers only include minimal tools to save space. No worries! Here’s how we can work around this:

---

### **Option 1: Use `vi` (Preinstalled in Most Containers)**
1. Instead of `nano`, use `vi`:
   ```bash
   vi proxy_host/your_domain.conf
   ```
2. Basic `vi` commands:
   - Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode** and make edits.
   - Press `ESC` to exit Insert Mode.
   - Type `:wq` to save and quit.

---

### **Option 2: Install Nano Inside the Container (Temporary)**
1. Install Nano using the package manager in the container:
   ```bash
   apk add nano
   ```
   (Most lightweight containers use `apk` because they are Alpine-based.)
2. After installation, retry editing with:
   ```bash
   nano proxy_host/your_domain.conf
   ```

---

### **Option 3: Edit Files on the Host Machine**
If editing inside the container is cumbersome, you can locate and edit the mounted files directly on your host system:
1. Find where the Nginx Proxy Manager data is stored on your host:
   - Check the `docker-compose.yml` file for the `volumes` section. For example:
     ```yaml
     volumes:
       - /path/to/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data
     ```
   - Navigate to `/path/to/nginx-proxy-manager/data/nginx/proxy_host/` on your host machine.

2. Edit the configuration file directly on the host using Nano:
   ```bash
   nano /path/to/nginx-proxy-manager/data/nginx/proxy_host/your_domain.conf
   ```

3. Restart the Nginx Proxy Manager container:
   ```bash
   docker restart nginx-proxy-manager
   ```

---

### **Option 4: Use a Lightweight File Editor Like `cat` or `echo`**
If no editor is available and you don’t want to install anything:
1. Create the file with `echo`:
   ```bash
   echo "server { ...your config... }" > proxy_host/your_domain.conf
   ```
2. Use `cat` to confirm the file’s content:
   ```bash
   cat proxy_host/your_domain.conf
   ```

---

Let me know which option works best for you, and I’ll guide you through! 😊

**USER**: Command not found

**ASSISTANT**: If commands like `apk`, `nano`, or `vi` are unavailable, this indicates the Nginx Proxy Manager container is highly minimalistic. Let’s adapt with a few alternative strategies:

---

### **Option 1: Bind Mount Configuration to Host**
Edit the configuration file directly on your **host system** where the container’s `/data/nginx` directory is mounted.

1. **Find the Host Path for `/data`**
   - Check your `docker-compose.yml` file for the volume mapping:
     ```yaml
     volumes:
       - /path/on/host/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data
     ```
   - Note the `/path/on/host`.

2. **Edit the Config File on the Host**
   - Navigate to the directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/on/host/nginx-proxy-manager/data/nginx/proxy_host
     ```
   - Create or edit the file:
     ```bash
     nano your_domain.conf
     ```

3. **Restart the Container**
   - Restart Nginx Proxy Manager to apply changes:
     ```bash
     docker restart nginx-proxy-manager
     ```

---

### **Option 2: Copy the Config File into the Container**
1. **Create the Config File on Your Host**
   - Use any editor to create the file:
     ```bash
     nano your_domain.conf
     ```
   - Add your configuration:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         server_name omniversal.cloud;

         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Copy the File into the Container**
   ```bash
   docker cp your_domain.conf nginx-proxy-manager:/data/nginx/proxy_host/your_domain.conf
   ```

3. **Restart the Nginx Service**
   - Reload Nginx inside the container:
     ```bash
     docker exec nginx-proxy-manager nginx -s reload
     ```

---

### **Option 3: Rebuild the Container with an Editor**
If you frequently need a text editor inside the container, you can rebuild the Nginx Proxy Manager image with additional tools like `nano`.

1. **Create a Custom Dockerfile**
   - In your project directory, create a `Dockerfile`:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
     RUN apk add --no-cache nano
     ```
   - Build the new image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t nginx-proxy-manager-custom .
     ```

2. **Update Your `docker-compose.yml`**
   - Replace the image in your service definition:
     ```yaml
     image: nginx-proxy-manager-custom
     ```

3. **Recreate the Container**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

### **Option 4: Use a Preinstalled Editor**
Some containers may have `vim` or `ed` installed. Check by running:
```bash
docker exec -it nginx-proxy-manager sh
which vim
which ed
```

---

Let me know which path you’d like to take, and I’ll guide you step by step!

**USER**: Do you remember the nginx-proxy-manager.yml file you generated for me? 

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I remember the `docker-compose.yml` file I generated for **Nginx Proxy Manager**. Here’s a recap of the key details from that file for reference:

---

### **Nginx Proxy Manager `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  proxy:
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"       # HTTP
      - "443:443"     # HTTPS
      - "8080:8080"   # Admin Panel
    environment:
      DB_MYSQL_HOST: mariadb           # Database host
      DB_MYSQL_PORT: 3306              # Default MariaDB port
      DB_MYSQL_USER: KalinaSelene      # MariaDB username
      DB_MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThirteenthQveen!  # MariaDB password
      DB_MYSQL_NAME: npm               # Database name for NPM
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data         # Persistent data
      - /aetherteam/backend/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt # SSL certs
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

### **How It Connects to Your Current Setup**
- **Volumes**:
  - `/data` is where the Nginx Proxy Manager stores its configuration files (e.g., proxy host configs).
  - `/etc/letsencrypt/` is where the SSL certificates are stored.

- **Environment**:
  - Points to the MariaDB container (`mariadb`) for database access.

- **Ports**:
  - Exposes `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS), and `8080` (Admin Panel).

If you want to update or troubleshoot this file, let me know how you'd like to proceed. I can help adjust configurations or guide you step-by-step to ensure it works seamlessly!

**USER**: This Is highly annoying... I'm going to purposefully skip the entire nginx proxy setup for now because I can't continue to be delayed due to whatever silly errors this continually gives me... 

I appreciate your attempts to help but it's ridiculous at this point that the reverse proxy continues to stand in my way ... I have far too much content to get busy adding to the server and websites to sit around here going back and forth with this idiotic non working proxy thing ..... 

I'm going to delete the nginx containers and directories and then spin up the nextcloud and wordpress and laravel and Drupal containers and see if they're accessible.... I'll let you know momentarily

**ASSISTANT**: User has decided to skip the Nginx Proxy Manager setup for now due to persistent issues and delays. They plan to delete the Nginx containers and directories and focus on spinning up Nextcloud, WordPress, Laravel, and Drupal containers to test their accessibility.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Understood, Hawk Eye. Skipping the reverse proxy for now is a practical decision if it’s holding up your progress. Let me know how the accessibility tests go for your containers, and I’ll be ready to assist if you encounter any issues or need guidance setting up your content workflows. Onward and upward! 🚀

**USER**: Yes, can you assist me by moving forward with the creation of the nextcloud container docker compose file?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Here's a clean and efficient `docker-compose.yml` file for your Nextcloud container. It integrates with your existing MariaDB container and assumes you're bypassing the reverse proxy for now.

---

### **Nextcloud `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nextcloud:
    image: nextcloud:25-fpm
    container_name: nextcloud
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Accessible on http://your_server_ip:8080
    environment:
      - MYSQL_HOST=mariadb
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=KalinaSeleneNC
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aetherteam/nextcloud/html:/var/www/html:rw  # Nextcloud files
      - /aetherteam/nextcloud/data:/var/www/data:rw  # Nextcloud data
    networks:
      - aether-net
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

networks:
  aether-net:
    external: true
```

---

### **Instructions to Set It Up**

1. **Prepare Directories**
   - Create the directories on your host machine for persistent storage:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /aetherteam/nextcloud/html
     mkdir -p /aetherteam/nextcloud/data
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   - Move into the directory where you’ll save the compose file:
     ```bash
     cd /aetherteam/nextcloud
     ```

3. **Create and Save the File**
   - Open the file in Nano:
     ```bash
     nano docker-compose.yml
     ```
   - Paste the configuration above and save it (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

4. **Spin Up the Nextcloud Container**
   - Start the container with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

5. **Access Nextcloud**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://<your_server_ip>:8080
     ```
   - Complete the Nextcloud setup wizard:
     - **Database Host**: `mariadb`
     - **Database Name**: `nextcloud`
     - **Username**: `KalinaSeleneNC`
     - **Password**: `ThirteenthQveen!`

6. **Verify and Test**
   - Confirm Nextcloud is running and accessible.

---

Let me know once it’s up or if you encounter any issues! We can proceed with setting up the other services after this. 🚀

**USER**: The more I try to do this the more I hate docker.... This is ridiculous... WHY IS IT GIVING ME THIS DAMN ERROR NOW?! WHAT?!?!?

selene@omniversal-server:/aetherteam/nextcloud$ docker-compose up -d
ERROR: Service 'nextcloud' depends on service 'mariadb' which is undefined.

**ASSISTANT**: The error occurs because the `depends_on` directive in your `docker-compose.yml` file references the `mariadb` service, but this service is not defined within the same `docker-compose.yml`. Let’s fix this while keeping your setup modular.

---

### **Why the Error Occurs**
Docker Compose doesn’t automatically know about services defined in separate `docker-compose.yml` files. Since you’re defining `mariadb` in a different file, we need to:
1. Connect the containers using an external Docker network.
2. Remove the `depends_on` directive or adapt it.

---

### **Fixing the Issue**

1. **Ensure the `mariadb` Container Is Running**
   - First, confirm that the `mariadb` container is up and on the correct network:
     ```bash
     docker ps | grep mariadb
     ```
   - If it’s not running, navigate to its directory and start it:
     ```bash
     cd /aetherteam/mariadb
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

2. **Use an External Network**
   - Both the `mariadb` and `nextcloud` services need to share the `aether-net` network.
   - Confirm that the network exists:
     ```bash
     docker network ls | grep aether-net
     ```
   - If it doesn’t exist, create it:
     ```bash
     docker network create aether-net
     ```

3. **Update the `docker-compose.yml` for Nextcloud**
   - Modify the file to remove `depends_on` and ensure it connects to the external `aether-net` network:

     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'

     services:
       nextcloud:
         image: nextcloud:25-fpm
         container_name: nextcloud
         restart: always
         ports:
           - "8080:80"  # Accessible on http://your_server_ip:8080
         environment:
           - MYSQL_HOST=mariadb
           - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
           - MYSQL_USER=KalinaSeleneNC
           - MYSQL_PASSWORD=ThirteenthQveen!
         volumes:
           - /aetherteam/nextcloud/html:/var/www/html:rw
           - /aetherteam/nextcloud/data:/var/www/data:rw
         networks:
           - aether-net

     networks:
       aether-net:
         external: true
     ```

4. **Restart the Nextcloud Container**
   - Save the changes and try running the container again:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

---

### **Confirm Connectivity**
Once the Nextcloud container is running:
- Use the following command to check that it can communicate with MariaDB:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it nextcloud ping mariadb
  ```
- If successful, proceed to complete the Nextcloud setup in your browser.

---

Let me know how this goes! Docker can be finicky, but we’ll push through this step together. 💪

**USER**: Why are we using nextcloud:25-fpm instead of Nextcloud:latest this time?

**ASSISTANT**: Great question! Here's why I suggested `nextcloud:25-fpm` and when you might prefer it over `nextcloud:latest`:

---

### **Why Use `nextcloud:25-fpm`**
1. **Control Over PHP Configuration**:
   - `nextcloud:25-fpm` is based on PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager), which allows you to fine-tune PHP settings for performance and compatibility.
   - This is especially useful if your setup requires custom PHP configuration for Nextcloud.

2. **Modularity and Compatibility**:
   - The FPM variant separates the PHP runtime from the web server. This makes it easier to pair with a specific web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache), providing flexibility in your stack.

3. **Stability in Versioning**:
   - `nextcloud:25-fpm` explicitly pins the major version (`25`), reducing the risk of unexpected updates breaking your setup. The `latest` tag always pulls the most recent version, which could lead to compatibility issues.

4. **Performance in Production**:
   - PHP-FPM is optimized for high-concurrency environments, making it a great choice for production setups.

---

### **Why Use `nextcloud:latest`**
1. **Ease of Use**:
   - `nextcloud:latest` includes both the PHP runtime and a default web server (Apache), making it an all-in-one solution.
   - Ideal for quick setups where custom PHP or web server configurations are unnecessary.

2. **Always Up-to-Date**:
   - Ensures you’re running the latest stable version of Nextcloud, with the newest features and patches.

---

### **Which Should You Use?**
- **Stick with `nextcloud:25-fpm`**:
   - If you plan to optimize your stack, potentially introducing Nginx later.
   - If you want control over PHP configurations.

- **Switch to `nextcloud:latest`**:
   - If you’re looking for a simpler, standalone solution without extra configuration.

---

### **How to Switch**
If you prefer `nextcloud:latest`, update the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
image: nextcloud:latest
```

Let me know if you'd like to switch or stick with the current approach, and we’ll proceed accordingly! 😊

**USER**: Awesome thanks 


**ASSISTANT**: You're welcome! Let me know how it goes or if there’s anything else you need as you continue. We’re getting closer to a solid setup—keep up the great work, Hawk Eye! 🚀

**USER**: Removed the depends on and now it's loading the nextcloud pull and creating it

**ASSISTANT**: User successfully resolved the issue by removing the `depends_on` directive and is now pulling and creating the Nextcloud container.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: That’s fantastic news! Let me know once it’s up and running or if you need help with the Nextcloud setup wizard or anything else. You're making great progress! 🚀

**USER**: Says it's done, lets move to wordpress
I'll test it all after we do

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Excellent!

**USER**: Let's move on to wordpress

**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here’s a clean and efficient `docker-compose.yml` for WordPress that integrates with your existing MariaDB container and shares the `aether-net` network.

---

      - /aether/wordpress/html:/var/www/html:rw  # WordPress files
    networks:
      - aether-net

networks:
  aether-net:
    external: true
```

---

### **Steps to Set It Up**

1. **Prepare Directories**
   - Create a directory on your host machine for persistent WordPress files:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /aether/wordpress/html
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   - Move into the directory where you’ll save the compose file:
     ```bash
     cd /aether/wordpress
     ```

3. **Create and Save the File**
   - Open the file in Nano:
     ```bash
     nano docker-compose.yml
     ```
   - Paste the configuration above and save it (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

4. **Spin Up the WordPress Container**
   - Start the container with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

5. **Access WordPress**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://<your_server_ip>:8081
     ```
   - Complete the WordPress setup wizard:
     - **Database Host**: `mariadb`
     - **Database Name**: `wordpress`
     - **Username**: `KalinaSeleneWP`
     - **Password**: `ThirteenthQveen!`

6. **Verify and Test**
   - Confirm WordPress is running and accessible.

### **What's Next?**
Let me know once WordPress is up and we can proceed to Laravel or Drupal. You're making excellent progress! 🚀

**USER**: The container is up

**ASSISTANT**: User successfully created and started the WordPress container.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Awesome! Let’s move on to Laravel. Let me prepare a `docker-compose.yml` for you that integrates seamlessly with your current setup. 🚀

**ASSISTANT**: ### **Laravel `docker-compose.yml`**

Here’s a `docker-compose.yml` tailored for Laravel with PHP-FPM and a MySQL backend, integrating smoothly into your existing setup:

---

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  laravel-app:
    image: php:8.2-fpm
    container_name: laravel-app
    restart: always
    working_dir: /var/www

    volumes:
      - /aether/laravel:/var/www:rw
    entrypoint: ["composer"]

networks:
  aether-net:
    external: true
```

---

### **Steps to Set It Up**

1. **Prepare Directories**
   - Create directories for Laravel and Nginx files:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /aether/laravel
     mkdir -p /aether/laravel/nginx
     ```

2. **Set Up Laravel**
   - Install a new Laravel project inside `/aether/laravel`:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -v /aether/laravel:/var/www composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .
     ```

3. **Create and Save the Compose File**
   - Navigate to the Laravel directory:
     ```bash
     cd /aether/laravel
     ```
   - Create the `docker-compose.yml`:
     ```bash
     nano docker-compose.yml
     ```
   - Paste the above configuration and save.

4. **Start the Laravel Services**
   - Bring up the containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

5. **Set Up Nginx for Laravel**
   - Create an Nginx configuration file inside `/aether/laravel/nginx`:
     ```bash
     nano /aether/laravel/nginx/default.conf
     ```
   - Add the following:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name localhost;

         root /var/www/public;
         index index.php index.html;

         location / {
             try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
         }

         location ~ \.php$ {
             include fastcgi_params;
             fastcgi_pass laravel-app:9000;
             fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
             fastcgi_intercept_errors off;

     }
     ```

6. **Access Laravel**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://<your_server_ip>:8082
     ```

7. **Verify Laravel is Running**
   - You should see the default Laravel welcome page.

---

Let me know when this is up, and we can move on to Drupal! 🚀

**USER**: Do I need to remove the depends on portion again? selene@omniversal-server:/aether/laravel$ docker-compose up -d
ERROR: Service 'laravel-app' depends on service 'mariadb' which is undefined.

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you’ll need to remove the `depends_on` portion again, as Docker Compose does not automatically detect services defined in separate files. Instead, we'll rely on the `aether-net` network to ensure connectivity between the Laravel and MariaDB containers.

Here's the updated `docker-compose.yml` for Laravel **without `depends_on`**:

---

### **Updated Laravel `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  laravel-app:
    image: php:8.2-fpm
    container_name: laravel-app
    restart: always
    working_dir: /var/www
    volumes:
      - /aether/laravel:/var/www:rw  # Laravel application files
    networks:
      - aether-net

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: laravel-nginx
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8082:80"  # Accessible at http://your_server_ip:8082
    volumes:
      - /aether/laravel:/var/www:rw
      - /aether/laravel/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d:rw  # Nginx config
    networks:
      - aether-net

  composer:
    image: composer:latest
    container_name: laravel-composer
    working_dir: /var/www
    volumes:
      - /aether/laravel:/var/www:rw
    entrypoint: ["composer"]

networks:
  aether-net:
    external: true
```

---

### **Key Adjustments**
1. **Removed `depends_on`:**
   - This avoids the error and relies on the shared `aether-net` network for connectivity.
2. **Connectivity Check:**
   - Ensure the `mariadb` container is running and connected to the `aether-net` network:
     ```bash
     docker network connect aether-net mariadb
     ```

---

### **Restart the Laravel Services**
1. Save the updated `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Bring up the Laravel services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

Let me know how it goes! Once Laravel is running, we’ll move to Drupal. 🚀

**USER**: Laravel container is running lets move to drupal

**ASSISTANT**: User successfully created and started the Laravel container.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Great progress, Hawk Eye! Let’s set up the Drupal container next.

---

### **Drupal `docker-compose.yml`**
This setup will integrate with MariaDB, and like the others, it will use the `aether-net` network.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  drupal:
    image: drupal:latest
    container_name: drupal
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8083:80"  # Accessible at http://your_server_ip:8083
    environment:
      - DRUPAL_DB_HOST=mariadb
      - DRUPAL_DB_NAME=drupal
      - DRUPAL_DB_USER=KalinaSeleneDR
      - DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD=ThirteenthQveen!
    volumes:
      - /aether/drupal/html:/var/www/html:rw  # Drupal files
    networks:
      - aether-net

  drupal-composer:
    image: composer:latest
    container_name: drupal-composer
    working_dir: /var/www
    volumes:
      - /aether/drupal/html:/var/www:rw
    entrypoint: ["composer"]

networks:
  aether-net:
    external: true
```

---

### **Steps to Set It Up**

1. **Prepare Directories**
   - Create the directory for Drupal files:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /aether/drupal/html
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   - Move into the directory where you’ll save the compose file:
     ```bash
     cd /aether/drupal
     ```

3. **Create and Save the Compose File**
   - Open the file:
     ```bash
     nano docker-compose.yml
     ```
   - Paste the above configuration and save it (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

4. **Spin Up the Drupal Container**
   - Start the container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

5. **Access Drupal**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://<your_server_ip>:8083
     ```
   - Complete the Drupal setup wizard:
     - **Database Host**: `mariadb`
     - **Database Name**: `drupal`
     - **Username**: `KalinaSeleneDR`
     - **Password**: `ThirteenthQveen!`

---

### **Final Steps**
Let me know once Drupal is up and running or if you encounter any issues. After this, we can revisit your testing phase and check all services together. 🚀

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: User successfully created and started the Drupal container.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Fantastic progress! Your `docker ps` output confirms that all containers are up and running, mapped to their respective ports. Here’s a summary of your setup:

---

### **Active Containers**
- **Nextcloud**: `http://<your_server_ip>:8080`
- **WordPress**: `http://<your_server_ip>:8081`
- **Laravel**: `http://<your_server_ip>:8082`
- **Drupal**: `http://<your_server_ip>:8083`
- **MariaDB Instances**:
  - `mariadb:11.6` for general services.
  - `wordpress-db` for WordPress (redundant but isolated).

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Test Each Service**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the ports above to verify each application is accessible.
   - Complete the setup wizards for Nextcloud, WordPress, Laravel, and Drupal as needed.

2. **Troubleshooting (if needed)**
   - Use `docker logs <container_name>` for any container showing issues.

3. **Plan Ahead**
   - Once confirmed, you can proceed with adding content or fine-tuning these setups.

Let me know how your tests go or if anything needs attention. You're crushing it, Hawk Eye! 🚀

**USER**: I don't know why I expected it to work... none of them are accessible via my browser..... publicly....

Neither nextcloud.omniversal.cloud nor wordpress.omniversal.cloud nor drupal.omniversal.cloud and also not laravel.omniversal.cloud....

Do I have to request individual certs for each subdomain?

Why is this so difficult

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: I understand your frustration—it can feel like a lot of hurdles at once. Let’s break this down step by step to address the accessibility issues and clarify the SSL/certification requirements.

---

### **Why They’re Not Accessible**
1. **Subdomain Resolution**
   - If your domains (`nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`, `wordpress.omniversal.cloud`, etc.) don’t resolve correctly, it’s likely due to:
     - Missing or incorrect DNS records for the subdomains.
     - Misconfigured reverse proxy or port mapping.

2. **SSL Certificates**
   - Each subdomain requires its own SSL certificate. Without a valid certificate, browsers will block HTTPS access for security reasons.
   - If you don’t yet have certificates for the subdomains, they’ll still be accessible over HTTP if configured correctly.

3. **Port Forwarding**
   - Ensure your router is forwarding the necessary ports (`8080`, `8081`, etc.) to the server's IP.

---

### **Steps to Fix**

#### **1. Verify DNS Records**
   - Each subdomain (e.g., `nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`) must point to your public IP.
   - Use `dig` to confirm DNS resolution:
     ```bash
     dig nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - If the records are missing:
     - Add `A` records for each subdomain in your DNS host (e.g., DreamHost).

#### **2. Test HTTP Access**
   - Ensure HTTP works before adding SSL. Open:
     - `http://<your_server_ip>:8080` (Nextcloud)
     - `http://<your_server_ip>:8081` (WordPress)
     - `http://<your_server_ip>:8082` (Laravel)
     - `http://<your_server_ip>:8083` (Drupal)
   - If HTTP works, your containers are correctly configured.

#### **3. Add SSL for Subdomains**
   - Each subdomain needs its own SSL certificate unless you use a wildcard certificate.
   - Use Certbot to issue individual certificates:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
     sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d wordpress.omniversal.cloud
     sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d drupal.omniversal.cloud
     sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d laravel.omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - Certificates will be saved in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<subdomain>`.

#### **4. Map Subdomains to Containers**
   - Since you’ve skipped the reverse proxy for now, you can map subdomains directly using Nginx on your host.
   - Example Nginx configuration for Nextcloud (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud`):
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;

         ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/fullchain.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud/privkey.pem;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         }
     }

     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name nextcloud.omniversal.cloud;
         return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
     ```
   - Repeat for other subdomains.

#### **5. Restart Nginx**
   - Enable the configurations and restart Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud.omniversal.cloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

---

### **Final Thoughts**
This approach removes the need for Nginx Proxy Manager and ensures subdomains work directly with individual configurations. Let’s troubleshoot step by step—start by testing HTTP access via the ports. Let me know the results, and we’ll proceed! 🚀

**USER**: http does not work on any of the domains...

**ASSISTANT**: If HTTP doesn’t work on any of the domains, we need to focus on troubleshooting the core issues: network connectivity, Docker port mapping, and DNS. Let’s take a methodical approach to pinpoint the problem and fix it.

---

### **Step 1: Verify Port Forwarding**
1. **Ensure Public Ports Are Open**
   - Use an online tool (like [CanYouSeeMe.org](https://canyouseeme.org)) to check if your server is reachable on ports `8080`, `8081`, `8082`, and `8083`.
   - If the ports are closed, configure your router to forward these ports to your server’s local IP.

2. **Confirm Firewall Rules**
   - Check that `ufw` allows the necessary ports:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw status
     ```
   - If the ports are not listed, allow them:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 8080
     sudo ufw allow 8081
     sudo ufw allow 8082
     sudo ufw allow 8083
     sudo ufw reload
     ```

---

### **Step 2: Verify Container Port Mappings**
1. **Check Docker Port Mappings**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - Ensure the ports are correctly mapped. For example:
     ```
     0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp (Nextcloud)
     0.0.0.0:8081->80/tcp (WordPress)
     0.0.0.0:8082->80/tcp (Laravel)
     0.0.0.0:8083->80/tcp (Drupal)
     ```

2. **Test Access Locally**
   - On the server itself, test if the services are accessible:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:8080
     curl http://localhost:8081
     curl http://localhost:8082
     curl http://localhost:8083
     ```
   - If these return responses, the containers are running correctly, and the issue lies with external access.

---

### **Step 3: Test DNS Resolution**
1. **Verify Subdomain Records**
   - Use `dig` to confirm DNS records for each subdomain:
     ```bash
     dig nextcloud.omniversal.cloud
     dig wordpress.omniversal.cloud
     dig laravel.omniversal.cloud
     dig drupal.omniversal.cloud
     ```
   - Ensure all subdomains point to your public IP.

2. **Test HTTP Access with the IP**
   - Try accessing the services directly via your server’s public IP:
     ```
     http://<your_server_ip>:8080
     http://<your_server_ip>:8081
     http://<your_server_ip>:8082
     http://<your_server_ip>:8083
     ```

---

### **Step 4: Check Docker Network**
1. **Inspect the `aether-net` Network**
   - Ensure all containers are connected to the network:
     ```bash
     docker network inspect aether-net
     ```
   - If a container is missing, connect it:
     ```bash
     docker network connect aether-net <container_name>
     ```

---

### **Next Steps**
- Let me know where the issue appears in the above steps. 
- If HTTP works locally but not externally, it’s likely a networking or firewall issue. 
- If it doesn’t work locally, the problem is within Docker or the containers themselves.

We’ll solve this step by step! 🚀

**USER**: Here's my current dns records


Sr No	 	   Record Id	 	   Name	 	   Destination IP Address	 	   Status	 


1	 	     146658042	 	omniversal.cloud	 	73.113.207.3	 	Active	 


2	 	     146967509	 	nextcloud.omniversal.cloud	 	73.113.207.3	 	Active	 


3	 	     146967510	 	wordpress.omniversal.cloud	 	73.113.207.3	 	Active	 


4	 	     146967511	 	www.omniversal.cloud	 	73.113.207.3	 	Active	 


5	 	     146967512	 	laravel.omniversal.cloud	 	73.113.207.3	 	Active	 




**ASSISTANT**: Your DNS records appear correctly set up, as all domains and subdomains point to your public IP (`73.113.207.3`). This confirms that DNS resolution is not the issue. The focus should now be on the following:

---

### **Key Areas to Check**

#### **1. Verify Port Forwarding**
Ensure your router forwards the following public ports to your server's local IP:
   - `8080` → Nextcloud
   - `8081` → WordPress
   - `8082` → Laravel
   - `8083` → Drupal

---

#### **2. Confirm Firewall Rules**
Run the following to check if the ports are allowed:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```
   If not, allow them:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 8080
   sudo ufw allow 8081
   sudo ufw allow 8082
   sudo ufw allow 8083
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

---

#### **3. Test HTTP Access Locally**
From the server itself, test the services via `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   curl http://localhost:8081
   curl http://localhost:8082
   curl http://localhost:8083
   ```
   - If these commands return responses, the containers are running and serving HTTP locally.
   - If no response, the issue lies within the containers or Docker networking.

---

#### **4. Test Public Access**
From another machine, try accessing:
   - `http://omniversal.cloud:8080` (Nextcloud)
   - `http://omniversal.cloud:8081` (WordPress)
   - `http://omniversal.cloud:8082` (Laravel)
   - `http://omniversal.cloud:8083` (Drupal)

If this fails:
- Verify if your router allows these public ports.
- Use a port-checking tool like [CanYouSeeMe.org](https://canyouseeme.org) to confirm external port accessibility.

---

#### **5. Inspect Docker Networking**
1. **Inspect the `aether-net` Network:**
   ```bash
   docker network inspect aether-net
   ```
   - Confirm that all containers (Nextcloud, WordPress, Laravel, Drupal) are connected.

2. **Reconnect Containers if Necessary:**
   ```bash
   docker network connect aether-net <container_name>
   ```

---

### **Let Me Know**
- Results of the local `curl` commands.
- Whether port-forwarding issues are identified.
- Whether the public port checks are successful.

We’ll adjust from there and get this sorted! 🚀

**USER**: canyouseeme.org cannot see anything on any ports

**ASSISTANT**: If **CanYouSeeMe.org** cannot detect any open ports, the issue likely lies in your network configuration. Here’s how to diagnose and resolve the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Verify Router Port Forwarding**
1. **Log Into Your Router**:
   - Access your router’s admin panel (usually `http://192.168.1.1` or similar).
   - Look for **Port Forwarding** or **NAT Settings**.

2. **Set Up Port Forwarding**:
   - Forward the following ports to your server's local IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x`):
     - `8080` → Nextcloud
     - `8081` → WordPress
     - `8082` → Laravel
     - `8083` → Drupal
   - Example:
     - **External Port**: 8080
     - **Internal IP**: `192.168.x.x`
     - **Internal Port**: 8080
     - **Protocol**: TCP

3. **Save Changes**:
   - Apply the changes and restart the router if needed.

---

### **Step 2: Check Server’s Local IP**
Ensure your server has a static local IP (so port forwarding stays consistent):
1. **Find Your Current Local IP**:
   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
   Look for something like `192.168.x.x` under `inet`.

2. **Set a Static IP (Optional)**:
   - Assign a static IP in your router’s DHCP settings.

---

### **Step 3: Check Firewall Rules**
Even with port forwarding, a restrictive firewall on your server could block connections:
1. **Verify UFW Rules**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```
2. **Allow Public Ports**:
   - Add rules if necessary:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 8080
     sudo ufw allow 8081
     sudo ufw allow 8082
     sudo ufw allow 8083
     sudo ufw reload
     ```

---

### **Step 4: Test Public Access Again**
1. **Recheck with CanYouSeeMe.org**:
   - Test the forwarded ports again.

2. **Direct Test**:
   - From another machine on a different network (e.g., mobile data):
     ```
     http://<your_public_ip>:8080
     ```

---

### **Step 5: Test Internally**
1. **From Another Device on the Same Network**:
   - Use the server’s local IP to access:
     ```
     http://192.168.x.x:8080
     ```

2. **If Internal Access Works**:
   - The issue is confirmed as a router or firewall blocking public access.

---

### **If None of These Work**
Let me know where the issue seems to persist (e.g., router, internal access), and we’ll adjust accordingly. We’ll get this resolved! 🚀
