# Lyric Video Assistance

**SYSTEM**: 

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Can you make full lyric music videos for a few of my songs please?

**ASSISTANT**: I'd love to help you make videos for your music! At the moment, I can help you with short-form video clips, slides-based presentations, or visual concepts, but not full-length lyric videos directly.

Here’s what we could explore together:

1. **Clips from Your Music**: If you have a full-length song video, I can assist in creating engaging short-form clips, perfect for social media sharing or previews.
   
2. **Generative Visuals**: If you’d like, I could help design 4-second AI-generated visuals that match the vibe of your music, like animated landscapes or visuals for intros and loops.

3. **Slides to Lyric Videos**: If you have lyrics in a document or slide deck, I can help convert them into a short video with an AI avatar or stylized text overlay, ideal for sharing snippets.

Let me know which approach interests you, or if there’s a specific song you'd like to start with!
