**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for providing the contents of the Media Access Request. Based on what you've shared, the request was made citing constitutional rights (First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution) and Ohio’s Rules of Superintendence for the Courts, Rule 12, which governs media access in courtrooms.

To draft an effective Writ of Mandamus, we’ll need to address the legal grounds for the court’s denial, including:

1. **First Amendment Rights**: The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of the press, which courts have interpreted to include reasonable access to court proceedings, especially for media covering public trials. You could argue that denying access infringes on these rights without a compelling justification.

2. **Ohio Constitution**: Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution also protects freedom of the press and may be cited to bolster your case.

3. **Ohio Rule of Superintendence 12**: This rule allows media to cover court proceedings under certain conditions, provided it doesn't disrupt the court's operation. If you followed the rule’s requirements (e.g., agreeing to serve as a pool representative), the court would need to provide a substantial reason to deny access.

### Next Steps:
- **Justify the Harm**: You’ll want to highlight how the denial of access harms your media organization by preventing you from performing your journalistic duties.
- **Demand the Court's Explanation**: Requesting clarification on why the court denied your request is crucial, as it may provide insight into whether they see a legitimate concern (such as courtroom decorum or witness protection) or if it’s a more arbitrary refusal.

We can now include these arguments in the Writ of Mandamus to strengthen your case.

Would you like to proceed with incorporating these legal arguments into the draft?

**USER**: Yes please

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s a revised version of the **Writ of Mandamus** with the legal arguments incorporated based on the grounds you provided:

This version now includes a claim for damages and details the wasted time and costs your team incurred. Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!

**USER**: Can we also include statements to emphasize the willful neglect on Washington Courthouse Municipal Court's part to communicate efficiently and its seeming unethical approach to eventually denying legal media access requests? Can we word things to reflect an estimated travel damages amount congruent with current fuel prices and the trip from Charlottesville, VA to New Holland, OH as well as estimated food and lodging costs? Can we reflect the costs of average cell phone service for a business line without being too specific, yet adequately enough to fulfill the purposes we are seeking? Can we infer our intent to file suit against the involved state agencies for violation of our Constitutionally Protected Rights of Free Speech and Free Press? Can we include the fact that what we have sought to obtain are recordings of OPEN COURT and state that Washington Courthouse's unethical violations of procedural misconduct are indicative of further malfeasance which they appear to seek to keep from being disclosed to the public? Can we include also Circleville Municipal Court's denied media requests into this writ, solely as a reference to indicate what appears to be a conspiracy against constitutional rights? What else can we state in our Writ to ensure we cover all legal basis' that are relevant?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Here’s an enhanced **Writ of Mandamus** based on your detailed instructions. I’ll incorporate statements emphasizing willful neglect, unethical actions, an estimated breakdown of damages, and other legal arguments such as violations of constitutionally protected rights. Additionally, I’ll reference **Circleville Municipal Court**’s actions as part of a larger pattern.

**IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO**

**OMNIVERSAL MEDIA, LLC,**  
**Petitioner,**  
vs.  
**WASHINGTON COURTHOUSE MUNICIPAL COURT,**  
**Respondent.**

**Case Nos.: CRB2400308, CRB2400072**

**WRIT OF MANDAMUS**

**COMES NOW** Omniversal Media, LLC, by and through undersigned counsel, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court to grant media access as required under law, and in support thereof, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES
1. **Petitioner**: Omniversal Media, LLC, is a media organization registered in the state of Virginia, with its principal office located at 450 Crafton Circle, Charlottesville, VA 22911, engaged in investigative journalism and public interest reporting.
2. **Respondent**: Washington Courthouse Municipal Court is a public entity and governmental body responsible for administering justice in **Fayette County**, State of Ohio.

### II. JURISDICTION
This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandamus pursuant to **Ohio Rules of Superintendence**, specifically Rule 12.1.

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
1. On August 2, 2024, Petitioner, through its Administrative Director, Ethan Womack, submitted a Media Access Request to the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court, seeking permission to record and/or photograph portions of court proceedings in cases CRB2400308 and CRB2400072, pursuant to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution, and Rule 12 of the Ohio Rules of Superintendence.
2. Petitioner agreed to serve in a media pool capacity and complied with all procedural requirements mandated by Rule 12.
3. Despite compliance, Petitioner’s requests were **willfully neglected** and ultimately denied by Respondent without clear justification or proper communication.
4. The repeated failure of Respondent to respond to reasonable follow-up communications from Petitioner, including several attempts by Petitioner’s Assistant Legal Director via phone, indicates a disregard for procedural transparency and raises concerns regarding the **unethical handling** of media access requests. 
5. The requests sought access to **open court proceedings**, which are inherently public under constitutional and state laws. The Respondent’s unjustified denial of such access is indicative of **procedural misconduct** and raises suspicions of further **malfeasance** that Respondent appears to be attempting to shield from public disclosure.
6. Additionally, **Circleville Municipal Court** has similarly denied Petitioner’s lawful media access requests under parallel circumstances, suggesting a **pattern of conspiratorial behavior** by local courts in the state of Ohio to systematically violate the constitutionally protected rights of free speech and free press, in direct contravention of the U.S. Constitution and Ohio Constitution.

### IV. LEGAL GROUNDS
1. **First Amendment Violation**: The denial of media access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press. The consistent failure to provide access to open court proceedings reflects an attempt to unlawfully stifle the press’s role in reporting matters of public concern.
   
2. **Violation of Ohio Constitution**: Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution guarantees the right of media organizations to report on matters of public concern. By denying access without adequate legal grounds, Respondent is violating this constitutional provision, further indicating **intentional misconduct**.

3. **Rule 12 of Ohio Rules of Superintendence**: Ohio Rule of Superintendence 12 governs media access to courtroom proceedings and sets forth clear procedures for obtaining such access. Petitioner’s request was made in full compliance with Rule 12. Respondent’s denial without explanation is a **direct violation** of this rule.

4. **Constitutional Violations**: Petitioner intends to pursue **legal action** against the involved state agencies for violating constitutionally protected rights of **free speech** and **free press**, which are fundamental to democratic governance. Respondent’s continued refusal to adhere to constitutional principles suggests deeper, more systemic issues within the administration of justice that must be addressed by this Court.

### V. DAMAGES
1. **Travel Costs**: Based on current fuel prices and the approximate distance from Charlottesville, VA to New Holland, OH (approximately 400 miles one way), Petitioner incurred significant travel expenses, including fuel costs of approximately $[insert amount], along with associated lodging and food costs for **Media Representative Caden Reed** and **Administrative Director Ethan Womack**, totaling approximately $[insert amount].
2. **Wasted Time**: The time spent by both Media Representative **Caden Reed** and Administrative Director **Ethan Womack** to coordinate and prepare for media coverage—including several failed attempts to obtain access—resulted in lost productivity. The estimated value of this wasted time is $[insert amount].
3. **Phone and Follow-Up Costs**: The multiple phone calls and follow-up efforts made by Petitioner’s Assistant Legal Director and business representatives to address the Respondent’s willful neglect, including cell phone service costs for business lines, incurred an additional $[insert amount].

### VI. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
1. Issue a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court to grant media access as requested by Omniversal Media, LLC;
2. Order Respondent to provide an explanation for the denials in accordance with Ohio Rule of Superintendence 12;
3. Acknowledge the unethical behavior and **procedural misconduct** of Respondent, as evidenced by their refusal to respond promptly to media access requests;
4. Award Petitioner compensatory damages for travel costs, wasted time, and the lack of transparency and ethical conduct in handling this matter;
5. Recognize Petitioner’s intent to pursue legal action against Respondent and related state agencies for **violation of constitutional rights**, including free speech and free press;

### Additional Legal Considerations:
1. **Patterns of Misconduct**: You can suggest that the pattern of media denials across multiple courts (Washington Courthouse and Circleville Municipal Court) may indicate broader efforts to suppress media coverage, thus warranting further scrutiny by the judiciary.
2. **Constitutional Redress**: You could strengthen your intent to file legal action for damages and violations of constitutional rights under both federal and state law, emphasizing how Respondent’s conduct violates not only procedural rules but the public’s trust in open judicial processes.

This draft includes the points you wanted emphasized. Let me know if you would like further adjustments or additional details!

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing the second denied media request for **Caden Reed** on behalf of **Omniversal Media, LLC**. I’ll ensure that this second denial is referenced in the updated **Writ of Mandamus** as further evidence of the **pattern of unjust denials** and procedural misconduct.

### Updated Section with Additional Denial Reference:
---

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
1. On **August 12, 2024**, Petitioner, through its Media Representative, **Caden Reed**, submitted a second Media Access Request to the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court, seeking permission to record and/or photograph portions of the court proceedings for **State of Ohio vs. Henderson, Case No. CRB2400308**, scheduled for **August 22, 2024**. This request was made pursuant to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution, and Rule 12 of the Ohio Rules of Superintendence.
2. Despite **full compliance** with Rule 12 and adherence to media pool obligations, the second request was similarly denied without explanation. The refusal to approve this media access request—following an earlier denied request—further underscores Respondent's **willful neglect** and violation of constitutionally protected rights.
3. The **pattern of denials** across two separate media access requests (including the August 2, 2024, request by Administrative Director **Ethan Womack**) demonstrates **procedural misconduct** and suggests that Respondent's actions are deliberately designed to **stifle press freedom** and prevent the public from accessing crucial court proceedings.
4. In addition to Washington Courthouse Municipal Court’s actions, **Circleville Municipal Court** has also denied media requests from Petitioner under similar circumstances, adding further weight to the claim that there is a **coordinated effort** to suppress media access to public trials.

---

By including the second denial (and referencing Circleville), this update strengthens the case by showing a **pattern** of unconstitutional actions and misconduct across multiple attempts to access open court proceedings. This supports your argument of systemic efforts to prevent media scrutiny.

Let me know if you’d like to incorporate any other specific points or adjustments!

**USER**: Are you able to compile everything from these drafts into one draft for me? 

**ASSISTANT**: Here is the compiled **Writ of Mandamus** based on all your requests:

---

**IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO**

**OMNIVERSAL MEDIA, LLC,**  
**Petitioner,**  
vs.  
**WASHINGTON COURTHOUSE MUNICIPAL COURT,**  
**Respondent.**

**Case Nos.: CRB2400308, CRB2400072**

**WRIT OF MANDAMUS**

**COMES NOW** Omniversal Media, LLC, by and through undersigned counsel, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court to grant media access as required under law, and in support thereof, states as follows:

### I. PARTIES
1. **Petitioner**: Omniversal Media, LLC, is a media organization registered in the state of Virginia, with its principal office located at 450 Crafton Circle, Charlottesville, VA 22911, engaged in investigative journalism and public interest reporting.
2. **Respondent**: Washington Courthouse Municipal Court is a public entity and governmental body responsible for administering justice in **Fayette County**, State of Ohio.

### II. JURISDICTION
This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandamus pursuant to **Ohio Rules of Superintendence**, specifically Rule 12.1.

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
1. On **August 2, 2024**, Petitioner, through its Administrative Director, **Ethan Womack**, submitted a Media Access Request to the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court, seeking permission to record and/or photograph portions of court proceedings in cases CRB2400308 and CRB2400072, pursuant to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution, and Rule 12 of the Ohio Rules of Superintendence.
2. Petitioner agreed to serve in a media pool capacity and complied with all procedural requirements mandated by Rule 12. Despite compliance, Petitioner’s request was **willfully neglected** and ultimately denied by Respondent without clear justification or proper communication.
3. On **August 12, 2024**, Petitioner, through its Media Representative, **Caden Reed**, submitted a second Media Access Request for the **State of Ohio vs. Henderson** (CRB2400308) for the court session scheduled on **August 22, 2024**. Like the earlier request, this request was denied without explanation despite adherence to Rule 12.
4. The **repeated denials** of media access reflect a **pattern of willful neglect**, unethical behavior, and procedural misconduct by Respondent. The denial of access to **open court proceedings**, which are inherently public, raises significant concerns of **malfeasance** and suggests efforts to conceal information from public scrutiny.
5. Multiple follow-up requests via phone by Petitioner’s Assistant Legal Director were similarly ignored, further demonstrating Respondent’s refusal to comply with its own Rules of Procedure.
6. **Circleville Municipal Court** has also denied Petitioner’s media access requests under similar circumstances, suggesting a **coordinated effort** across multiple courts to suppress media access and violate constitutionally protected rights of **free speech** and **free press**.

### IV. LEGAL GROUNDS
1. **First Amendment Violation**: The denial of media access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press. By preventing access to open court proceedings, Respondent has unlawfully stifled Petitioner’s ability to report on matters of public concern without any compelling government interest or justification.
   
2. **Violation of Ohio Constitution**: Article 1, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution guarantees the right of media organizations to report on matters of public concern. The denial of access without adequate legal grounds violates Petitioner’s rights under the Ohio Constitution and reflects **procedural misconduct**.

3. **Rule 12 of Ohio Rules of Superintendence**: Ohio Rule of Superintendence 12 governs media access to courtroom proceedings. Petitioner’s requests complied fully with Rule 12, including an agreement to serve in a media pool capacity. Respondent’s denial of these requests without explanation is a direct violation of this rule, undermining the principle of public access to judicial proceedings.

4. **Constitutional Violations**: Petitioner intends to pursue **legal action** against the involved state agencies for violating the Constitutionally Protected Rights of **free speech** and **free press**. The systematic denial of access, compounded by willful neglect and procedural violations, reflects a broader effort to prevent media scrutiny of public court proceedings.

### V. DAMAGES
1. **Travel Costs**: Based on current fuel prices and the distance from Charlottesville, VA to New Holland, OH (approximately 400 miles one way), Petitioner incurred significant travel expenses, including fuel costs estimated at **$[insert amount]**, along with lodging and food costs for **Media Representative Caden Reed** and **Administrative Director Ethan Womack**, totaling approximately **$[insert amount]**.
2. **Wasted Time**: Both Media Representative **Caden Reed** and Administrative Director **Ethan Womack** expended considerable time in coordinating and preparing for media coverage. This resulted in lost productivity valued at **$[insert amount]**.
3. **Phone and Follow-Up Costs**: Multiple phone calls and follow-up efforts made by Petitioner’s Assistant Legal Director and business representatives to address Respondent’s refusal to comply incurred additional costs amounting to **$[insert amount]**.
4. **Other Costs Incurred**: Any other costs arising from Respondent’s failure to comply with procedural rules will be further evaluated and submitted.

### VI. REQUEST FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:
1. Issue a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Washington Courthouse Municipal Court to grant media access as requested by Omniversal Media, LLC;
2. Order Respondent to provide an explanation for the denials in accordance with Ohio Rule of Superintendence 12;
3. Acknowledge the unethical behavior and **procedural misconduct** of Respondent, as evidenced by their refusal to respond promptly to media access requests;
4. Award Petitioner compensatory damages for travel costs, wasted time, and failure to uphold transparency in judicial proceedings;
5. Recognize Petitioner’s intent to pursue legal action against Respondent and related state agencies for **violations of constitutional rights**, including free speech and free press;
6. Grant such other relief as the Court deems appropriate and just.

**Respectfully submitted,**

Ethan Womack  
Administrative Director

This version includes all relevant details from your previous requests, including references to **both media denials**, claims of **unethical conduct**, and damages for **travel, time, and follow-up costs**. It also asserts **intent to file suit** against state agencies for violations of constitutional rights and emphasizes a **pattern of procedural misconduct**.

Let me know if you need any more revisions!

**USER**: Good morning, I'm curious if you can advise me on this Writ of Mandamus further


**ASSISTANT**: Good morning, Ethan! I'd be happy to advise you further on your **Writ of Mandamus**. Please let me know what specific areas you'd like to explore or refine. Are you seeking additional legal arguments, reviewing the likelihood of success, or considering how to best present this to the **Supreme Court of Ohio**? Feel free to share any specific concerns or questions you have, and we can dive deeper into them!

**USER**: Considering how best to present this to the Supreme Court of Ohio - My question is, if filing this petition on behalf of my company Omniversal Media, LLC do I need to have a Bar Associated Attorney or is this something that can be done within the company itself without the need of a law degree?

**ASSISTANT**: When filing a **Writ of Mandamus** in the **Supreme Court of Ohio** on behalf of **Omniversal Media, LLC**, it is important to consider the legal requirements around representation. Generally, **LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)** must be represented by a licensed attorney when appearing in court, including filing petitions like a Writ of Mandamus, because they are considered separate legal entities. Here’s how this typically works:

### 1. **Representation by an Attorney:**
   - In **Ohio**, like many states, non-lawyers (including company officers or directors) cannot represent an LLC in court, even if you are the owner or an officer of the company.
   - This requirement extends to all legal filings, including a **Writ of Mandamus**. The courts typically require that a licensed attorney represent the company to ensure that the filing and subsequent legal procedures adhere to legal standards.
   - Exceptions are rare, and they typically don’t apply to LLCs, especially in cases as complex as constitutional and procedural challenges.

### 2. **Filing as an Individual:**
   - If you were filing this petition on behalf of yourself as an individual, you could represent yourself **pro se** (without a lawyer), but this does not extend to **representing the LLC**.

### 3. **Next Steps:**
   - To ensure that your petition is properly filed, you will need to consult with or hire an attorney who is licensed in Ohio to represent **Omniversal Media, LLC**. This attorney can also assist with any legal nuances or procedural rules specific to the **Supreme Court of Ohio**.
   - You can still play an active role in drafting and preparing the petition, but the final submission and representation in court must come from a qualified attorney.

Would you like guidance on finding the right attorney, or are there other questions you'd like to explore in relation to the filing process?
