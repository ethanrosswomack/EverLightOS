# Raycast and Terminal Setup

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Is this thing working through ray cast? Is that what's happening?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: No, Raycast isn't what's making your terminal work here. You're using **zsh** on your Mac (as indicated by `theandromedaproject — -zsh`), and the commands you're running are interacting directly with your system.

What **Raycast** does is act as a powerful **launcher and automation tool** for macOS, kind of like a Spotlight replacement but with extra features. You installed it using Homebrew (`brew install --cask raycast`), but it's not affecting your terminal commands unless you explicitly use it.

The issue you originally ran into was that **Homebrew wasn’t installed**, which is why `brew` wasn’t recognized at first. Once you installed Homebrew and added it to your `PATH`, you were able to install Raycast successfully.

If you're wondering whether **Raycast is handling your terminal commands**, the answer is **no**—it’s just another application now installed on your Mac, sitting in `/Applications/`. If you open Raycast, you can use it to launch apps, run scripts, and even interact with the terminal in some cases, but it’s not controlling your current workflow unless you configure it to.

Let me know if you want to dive into using Raycast or if you're experiencing something unexpected!
