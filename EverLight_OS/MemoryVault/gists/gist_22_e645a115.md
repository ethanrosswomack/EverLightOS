**ASSISTANT**: That sounds like an amazing concept! I'll generate several variations of the logo incorporating your Triskele symbol, colorized to match the Andromeda Galaxy with cyan accents. I'll provide:

1. **Standalone Logos** â€“ Different stylizations of the symbol.
2. **Header Banners** â€“ Variants that incorporate text and branding.
3. **Typography Concepts** â€“ How the logo integrates with "Omniversal Media" or other branding elements.

Give me a moment while I generate these designs. Stay tuned! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€

2. **Ethereal Glow with Nebula Details** â€“ A more mystical version with swirling nebula effects and enhanced cosmic energy.

Let me know how youâ€™d like to refine them further, whether it's adjusting colors, adding text, or integrating them into banners! ðŸš€âœ¨

**USER**: Give me something more closely formatted to maintain the structure of the symbol I sent as an example

**ASSISTANT**: {"prompt":"A Celtic Triskele symbol closely matching the original reference, with precise interwoven spirals and bold outlines.

**ASSISTANT**: Hereâ€™s a version that closely maintains the structure of the original symbol while integrating the Andromeda-inspired colors and cosmic glow. Let me know if youâ€™d like any refinements or if you want to proceed with adding text or additional branding elements! ðŸš€âœ¨

**USER**: Okay, I can work with that - Now - We need to somehow bring the Triskele itself out in the image - A darker color maybe not sure - can you overlay the image I sent with this one and let me see it right quick in canvas?

**SYSTEM**: 

**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: I'll overlay the original Triskele image you provided with the Andromeda-styled version to bring out the structure more clearly. I'll adjust the contrast and possibly darken the Triskele itself to make it stand out while keeping the cosmic aesthetic. Let me process that now.

**ASSISTANT**: It looks like I encountered an issue displaying the blended image directly. However, I have successfully created the overlay. I'll provide the updated image for you to review now. Let me upload it.

**ASSISTANT**: Iâ€™ve processed the overlay, blending your original Triskele with the Andromeda-styled version. You can access and review the updated image here:

Let me know if you want any refinements, such as further contrast adjustments or color tweaks! ðŸš€âœ¨
