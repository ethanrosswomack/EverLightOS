# WordPress to Drupal Migration

**SYSTEM**: 

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Can you recreate https://omniversalmedia.com as it existed in 2021 but instead of using Wordpress convert things over for Drupal?

**ASSISTANT**: Recreating the Omniversal Media website as it existed in 2021 and migrating it from WordPress to Drupal involves several steps:

1. **Content Inventory**: Review the 2021 version of the Omniversal Media website to catalog all pages, posts, media files, and other content. This can be done using web archives like the Wayback Machine or by accessing backups.

2. **Drupal Installation**: Set up a new Drupal environment on your server. Ensure that the server meets Drupal's system requirements.

3. **Theme Development**: Replicate the design of the original WordPress site by creating a custom Drupal theme. This involves translating the site's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into Drupal's theming system.

4. **Content Migration**: Transfer content from WordPress to Drupal. This can be done manually or by using migration tools and modules that facilitate the import of WordPress content into Drupal.

5. **Functionality Implementation**: Recreate any custom functionalities, such as contact forms, galleries, or e-commerce features, using Drupal modules or custom development.

6. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the new Drupal site to ensure all content is displayed correctly, and functionalities work as intended.

7. **Deployment**: Once testing is complete, deploy the Drupal site to your live server.

Please note that this process requires technical expertise in both WordPress and Drupal. If you're not familiar with these platforms, consider consulting with a web developer experienced in migrations.
