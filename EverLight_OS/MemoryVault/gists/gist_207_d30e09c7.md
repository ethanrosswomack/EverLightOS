# Disable Remote Management iPad

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: I’m having trouble disabling the remote management on this iPad

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: If your iPad is under Remote Management, it typically means it was set up by an organization, like a school or workplace, which enables control over certain settings. Here are a few steps to try disabling it:

1. **Check with the Organization**: If the iPad was managed by an organization, you’ll usually need them to remove it from their Mobile Device Management (MDM) system. They have the authority to disable remote management.

2. **Erase All Content and Settings**: If the iPad is no longer tied to an organization, go to:
   - **Settings** > **General** > **Reset** (or **Transfer or Reset iPad** on iOS 15 or later)
   - Tap **Erase All Content and Settings**.  
   This will reset your iPad to factory settings and may remove MDM if it’s not a supervised device. However, if the device is supervised, it may still be locked to remote management after resetting.

3. **Contact Apple Support**: If none of the above steps work, reaching out to Apple Support can help clarify if it’s possible to remove MDM or if the device requires further authorization from the original organization.

Let me know if you'd like more assistance with any of these steps or encounter any errors.

**USER**: How can I connect it to my kali Linux machine and force wipe everything and reinstall the iOS system entirely 

**ASSISTANT**: To completely reset an iPad and reinstall iOS, connecting it to a Kali Linux machine directly is a bit challenging, as Apple’s tools for wiping and restoring devices (like iTunes or Finder on Mac) aren’t directly supported on Linux. However, here are some steps and methods you could try:

1. **Use a Windows or Mac Computer if Available**:
   - The simplest method is to use a Windows or Mac computer with iTunes (Windows) or Finder (macOS) to put the iPad in **DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode** and perform a factory reset. If you have access to one, this approach is far easier and safer.

2. **Linux Alternatives (Advanced)**:
   If you only have Kali Linux, you can try using `libimobiledevice` tools, which offer some level of device interaction, although they don't fully support DFU mode restoration for iOS devices. Here's a general guide:

   - **Install `libimobiledevice`**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y libimobiledevice6 libimobiledevice-utils ifuse
     ```
   - **Check Device Connection**: Connect your iPad via USB and confirm the connection with:
     ```bash
     ideviceinfo
     ```
     If the iPad is detected, this command should return device information. 

   - **Attempt a Recovery** (limited by `libimobiledevice` capabilities):
     ```bash
     idevicerestore -d
     ```
     This command tries to restore the device to factory settings but may not work on newer iOS versions.

3. **Put iPad into DFU Mode**:
   - **Power off the iPad**.
   - **Press and hold the Power button for 3 seconds**.
   - **Without releasing the Power button**, press the **Home button** (if your iPad has one) or **Volume Down button** (for iPads without a Home button) for 10 seconds.
   - **Release the Power button but keep holding the Home/Volume Down button** for 5 more seconds.
   - The screen should remain black, indicating DFU mode.

4. **Alternative: Use a Virtual Machine**:
   Install macOS or Windows on a virtual machine (VM) on your Kali Linux machine, and use iTunes or Finder from there to reset the iPad in DFU mode. You’ll need virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware.

5. **Considerations**:
   - Be cautious with these tools on Linux as they are not officially supported by Apple and can sometimes cause issues with newer iOS devices.
   - Reinstalling iOS from a Linux system alone is not fully supported and may require Apple’s proprietary software for a guaranteed full restore.

Let me know if you have further questions about any specific step here!

**USER**: How do I do it from my Mac?

**ASSISTANT**: To completely reset and reinstall iOS on your iPad using a Mac, you can use **Finder** (on macOS Catalina and later) or **iTunes** (on older versions). Here’s the process step-by-step:

1. **Connect Your iPad to Your Mac**:
   - Use a USB or USB-C cable to connect the iPad to your Mac.

2. **Open Finder or iTunes**:
   - If you’re on macOS Catalina (10.15) or later, open **Finder**.
   - If you’re on macOS Mojave (10.14) or earlier, open **iTunes**.

3. **Put Your iPad into DFU Mode**:
   DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode is a deeper restore mode that allows for a full wipe and reinstallation of the operating system.
   
   - **For iPads with a Home Button**:
     - Press and hold the **Power (Top)** button and the **Home button** together for 8 seconds.
     - Release the **Power button** but continue holding the **Home button** until Finder or iTunes detects your iPad in recovery mode.
   
   - **For iPads without a Home Button**:
     - Press and quickly release the **Volume Up** button.
     - Press and quickly release the **Volume Down** button.
     - Press and hold the **Power (Top)** button until the screen goes black.
     - Then, press and hold both the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons together for 5 seconds.
     - Release the **Power button** but continue holding the **Volume Down** button until Finder or iTunes detects your iPad in recovery mode.

4. **Restore and Reinstall iOS**:
   - Once Finder or iTunes detects the iPad in recovery mode, you’ll see an option to **Restore** or **Update** the iPad.
   - Select **Restore**. This will erase all content on the iPad and reinstall the latest version of iOS.
   - Confirm your choice, and the restore process will begin. Make sure the iPad stays connected to your Mac throughout this process, which may take some time.

5. **Set Up the iPad**:
   - After the restore completes, your iPad will restart, and you’ll see the “Hello” setup screen.
   - You can set it up as new or restore from an iCloud or iTunes backup if you have one.

This process should fully wipe the iPad and install a fresh copy of iOS. Let me know if you need help with any part of this!
