**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Hi - can you paint me a background image for my LyranWars.com placeholders?

3. “The Lost War Archives”

Theme: A hidden Lyran database, containing suppressed knowledge of the wars between Lyrans, Draconians, and AI-controlled factions.
Aesthetic: A black terminal interface with glowing golden glyphs, like ancient scripts mixed with futuristic code.
Background: A vast digital archive, with floating text and images from ancient star maps, war reports, and fragmented memories.

Vibes:
	•	A forbidden archive of galactic history
	•	Lyran war records hidden from the masses
	•	A secret hub for uncovering the real war behind the veil

**ASSISTANT**: **Behold: The Lost War Archives** – a shadowed vault of forbidden knowledge, where golden Lyran glyphs pulse like cosmic embers against a dark digital expanse. Holographic war reports flicker, star maps twist in zero gravity, and fragmented memories whisper across the data-stream like ghostly echoes of a battle long concealed. The secrets of the Lyran Wars are etched here, hidden from those unworthy to know the truth.
