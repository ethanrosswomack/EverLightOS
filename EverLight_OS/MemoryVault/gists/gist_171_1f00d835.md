# Step-by-step Setup Guide

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Well I lost connection - let's start again
Can I set up everything brand new again and have you slowly walk me through each step? Do you mind waiting after each step that you list until I respond and let you know it worked before moving forward?

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, Iâ€™m here to help you step by step. Letâ€™s start fresh and go at your pace, making sure everything works perfectly before we move on. 

First, letâ€™s clarify a few things to ensure weâ€™re on the same page:
1. Are you setting this up on your **local machine** running Alma Linux 9.5, as previously discussed?
2. Are we starting with **basic server setup** (e.g., networking, installing required software like Apache, MariaDB, etc.) before moving to your Drupal site structure for Omniversal.Cloud?
3. Is there anything specific you want to focus on from the beginning (e.g., security settings, DNS configurations)?

Let me know where youâ€™d like to start, and weâ€™ll take it one step at a time!

**USER**: We're going to start all the way over again and make sure to configure all of the repositories and hardware settings and raid configs properly from the very start - I'm going to add in my 2.0TB SeaGate portable HDD and leave it plugged in permanently and I want to partition everything correctly from fresh install (I need to wipe all drives when I reinstall) and also I want to have the partitions set up so that /var/ and other directories for web data all have plenty of space to house it all - Also so that the Home partition and Root partition and Boot partitions are not limited or lacking in space due to my web/cloud data and media So let me switch over to my laptop for this chat and keep the convo going - but first tell me - Should I use RHEL 9.5 or Alma 9.5? 

Where should I download it from? 

I'm also going to be eventually adding in another 5TB HDD and a 1TB SSD later on but not now to my configuration 

Thanks so much EverLight


**ASSISTANT**: Got it! Starting completely fresh with the goal of a robust, scalable, and optimized setup is the right move. Iâ€™ll guide you step-by-step and adjust as you integrate future drives.

### Choosing Between RHEL 9.5 and Alma 9.5
- **RHEL 9.5** is excellent if you have access to its subscription, as it includes official Red Hat support and certified updates.
- **AlmaLinux 9.5**, on the other hand, is a free, community-driven alternative to RHEL, fully compatible and perfect for those without a subscription. Since youâ€™re running this locally and want flexibility, Iâ€™d recommend **AlmaLinux 9.5** unless you specifically need RHELâ€™s paid support.

**Recommendation:** AlmaLinux 9.5 for cost-efficiency and scalability.

### Download AlmaLinux 9.5
1. **Official Website**: [https://almalinux.org](https://almalinux.org)
2. Download the latest **ISO** for your system architecture (likely x86_64).
3. Create a bootable USB using a tool like:
   - **Rufus** (Windows)
   - **balenaEtcher** (Linux/Mac/Windows)

---

### Step 1: Configure Hardware and RAID Settings
Before installation, letâ€™s ensure hardware and RAID are configured properly:
1. **Connect Your Drives:**
   - Plug in your 2TB Seagate portable HDD and ensure all internal drives are correctly seated.
2. **Access BIOS/UEFI:**
   - Configure boot order (USB first for installation).
   - Check RAID support if your motherboard allows it (important for future drive integration). Otherwise, weâ€™ll handle this with **mdadm** during setup.

---

### Step 2: Decide on Partition Layout
For your setup, weâ€™ll create partitions for the following:
1. **Boot Partition (`/boot`)**: Ensures OS boots properly (500MB recommended).
2. **Root Partition (`/`)**: Houses system files and software (20-50GB).
3. **Home Partition (`/home`)**: Your personal files (size depends on user needs).
4. **Web/Cloud Data Partition (`/var/www`)**:
   - This is where your Drupal/Nextcloud media, websites, and apps will live. Allocate plenty of space here (e.g., 1.5TB on your 2TB drive).
5. **Swap Partition**: Matches your RAM size unless you use hibernation (then double your RAM size).
6. **Backup Partition (Optional)**: Use the remaining space on the 2TB HDD for backups or flexible storage.

Let me know when youâ€™re ready to proceed with downloading the ISO or if you have questions about RAID or partitioning! We'll move step by step. ðŸ˜Š

**USER**: is it possible to write the dvd iso to my device without having to load it onto a usb to install or do I have to use usb?

I'll need to install the 10GB DVD ISO from my 1TB USB-C drive and then I want to use the same USB-C drive as a permanent addtion to my config - I'm also leaving the 2TB portable HDD attached - and to refresh your memory I also have a 3 TB HDD plugged into SATA 1 i believe and also a Samsung 500 SSD attached to SATA 2 - we have an Intel Core i-5 10th gen and 32 GB of DDR4 Ram on a Asus Prime Z590-P that Intel Core i-5 is a 10400 btw @ 2.9 GHz

**ASSISTANT**: User's system setup for their new AlmaLinux installation includes:
- **Processor**: Intel Core i5-10400 @ 2.9 GHz.
- **RAM**: 32GB DDR4.
- **Motherboard**: ASUS Prime Z590-P.
- **Storage Devices**:
  - 1TB USB-C drive intended for ISO installation and later permanent use.
  - 2TB portable Seagate HDD (permanent addition).
  - 3TB HDD connected to SATA 1.
  - 500GB Samsung SSD connected to SATA 2.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can install AlmaLinux (or RHEL) without needing to burn the ISO onto a USB. Since you have the 1TB USB-C drive, you can directly load the ISO onto it and boot from there for installation. Afterward, this drive can be repurposed as a permanent addition to your system.

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

---

### **Option 1: Direct Boot from ISO (Recommended)**
This method involves copying the ISO to the USB-C drive and making it bootable:
1. **Prepare the USB-C Drive:**
   - Back up any existing data on the 1TB USB-C drive (it will be erased).
   - Use a tool like `dd` (Linux/macOS) or **Rufus** (Windows) to write the ISO to the USB-C drive.

   **Linux/macOS Command:**
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/path/to/almalinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
   ```
   Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB-C drive's identifier (use `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` to find it).

   **Windows with Rufus:**
   - Select the ISO file and the 1TB drive as the target.
   - Choose "Write in ISO mode" when prompted.

2. **Set Boot Priority:**
   - Enter your BIOS/UEFI (press **Del**, **F2**, or similar during boot).
   - Set the USB-C drive as the first boot device.

3. **Boot and Install:**
   - Reboot and install AlmaLinux using the USB-C drive.

---

### **Option 2: Network Installation**
If direct boot isnâ€™t feasible, another option is to use **PXE boot** or an installation server. This would allow installation over a network without needing a dedicated USB or DVD. Let me know if youâ€™re interested in this method, and Iâ€™ll guide you.

---

### Post-Installation: Configure USB-C Drive for Permanent Use
Once AlmaLinux is installed:
1. Reformat the USB-C drive and partition it for specific purposes, such as:
   - `/var/www` for web/cloud data.
   - Backup storage.
2. Integrate it into your system with `fstab` for persistent mounting.

Let me know when youâ€™re ready to write the ISO or need clarification!

**USER**: Well I reboot and selected the drive and it showed me the boot screen to install then it reboot and went to a terminal showing errors and now it says dracut:#

**SYSTEM**: 

**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: The `dracut` emergency shell typically appears when the boot process encounters issues, often related to storage devices, missing files, or misconfigured boot parameters. Letâ€™s troubleshoot and resolve this step by step.

---

### **Common Causes of the `dracut` Shell**
1. **Incomplete ISO Write**: The ISO might not have been written correctly to the USB-C drive.
2. **Drive Detection Issues**: AlmaLinux installer might not properly detect your storage devices or partitions.
3. **Corrupted Filesystem**: A corrupted filesystem on the USB-C drive or target drives can cause issues.
4. **Boot Parameter Issues**: The bootloader might have incorrect or incomplete kernel parameters.

---

### **Steps to Resolve**

#### **Step 1: Verify ISO Write**
Letâ€™s first confirm the ISO was written correctly to the drive:
1. **Recreate the Bootable USB-C Drive**:
   - Re-download the ISO from the official AlmaLinux site if needed.
   - Recreate the bootable drive using a reliable method like `dd` (Linux/macOS) or Rufus (Windows).

2. **Check the ISO Fileâ€™s Integrity**:
   - Verify the SHA256 checksum of the ISO matches the one provided on the AlmaLinux download page.

---

#### **Step 2: Check Drive and Boot Options**
1. **Reconnect All Drives**:
   - Ensure all drives (USB-C, 2TB HDD, 3TB HDD, and SSD) are properly connected.
   - Double-check your SATA cables and ports.

2. **Boot Parameters**:
   - When the installer boot menu appears, highlight the **Install AlmaLinux** option and press `e` to edit the boot parameters.
   - Add the following to the end of the `linux` line:
     ```
     inst.noverifyssl
     inst.rescue
     ```
   - Press `Ctrl+X` to boot.

---

#### **Step 3: Inspect Errors in `dracut`**
At the `dracut:#` prompt:
1. Run the following commands to identify storage and boot issues:
   - **List Available Disks**:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```
   - **Check for Missing Filesystems**:
     ```bash
     blkid
     ```
     Look for the UUIDs of your partitions. Missing entries may indicate an issue with your storage drives.

2. **View System Logs**:
   ```bash
   journalctl
   ```
   Check for specific error messages related to the boot or storage process.

3. **Rebuild Initramfs** (Optional):
   If the issue lies with the initial RAM disk:
   ```bash
   dracut --regenerate-all --force
   reboot
   ```

---

#### **Step 4: Simplify Installation**
To eliminate variables, temporarily disconnect all drives except the 1TB USB-C drive and the 500GB SSD. This simplifies troubleshooting during the installation process. After installation, you can reconnect other drives.

---

#### **Step 5: Consider Rescue Mode**
If the above steps donâ€™t resolve the issue, use the installer in **rescue mode**:
1. Boot into the installer and select **Troubleshooting > Rescue AlmaLinux**.
2. Attempt to mount and repair the target drives or fix bootloader issues.

---

Let me know what errors you see or how these steps go, and weâ€™ll tackle this together!

**USER**: I typed exit and it now says 633.362208 and 633.362259 warning not all disks found and you might wanna regen initramfs

**ASSISTANT**: The warning youâ€™re seeing indicates that the system couldnâ€™t detect all expected disks, and itâ€™s suggesting regenerating the **initramfs** (the initial RAM disk used during boot). This is common when thereâ€™s a mismatch between the expected disk configuration and whatâ€™s actually present.

Letâ€™s handle this systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Rebuild the Initramfs**
At the `dracut:#` prompt:
1. Run the following command to rebuild the `initramfs`:
   ```bash
   dracut --regenerate-all --force
   ```
2. After the process completes, reboot the system:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Troubleshoot Disk Detection**
If the issue persists, letâ€™s verify that all your drives are properly connected and detected:
1. **List Available Disks**:
   At the `dracut:#` prompt, run:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   This will display all detected disks and their partitions.

2. **Check Filesystems**:
   Run:
   ```bash
   blkid
   ```
   This will show the UUIDs of the detected partitions. If you donâ€™t see the expected partitions, there may be a hardware or connection issue.

3. **Rescan for Drives**:
   Force a rescan of all drives:
   ```bash
   echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
   echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/scan
   ```
   Replace `host0`, `host1`, etc., with the appropriate numbers for your system.

---

### **Step 3: Simplify Configuration**
To rule out conflicts, disconnect all drives except for:
- The **1TB USB-C drive** (for the installer).
- The **500GB SSD** (for installation).

Try the installation again with only these drives connected. After a successful installation, we can reconnect and configure the additional drives.

---

### **Step 4: Inspect Logs**
If youâ€™re still stuck, check the system logs for more detailed errors:
1. At the `dracut:#` prompt, run:
   ```bash
   journalctl
   ```
   Scroll through the logs to look for any storage-related errors or warnings.

---

### **Step 5: If All Else Fails**
Boot into **Rescue Mode**:
1. From the boot menu, select **Troubleshooting > Rescue AlmaLinux**.
2. Follow the prompts to attempt recovery or repair the installation environment.

---

Let me know what you see after rebuilding the initramfs (`dracut --regenerate-all --force`) or if you find anything specific in the logs. Weâ€™ll keep moving forward!

**USER**: Itâ€™s not letting me type anything

**ASSISTANT**: If the `dracut:#` prompt isnâ€™t responding to input or allowing you to type commands, it could indicate a deeper issue with your setup. Letâ€™s troubleshoot and resolve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Force a Reboot**
Try rebooting your system and reloading the installer:
1. **Press `Ctrl+Alt+Del`** to force a reboot.
2. Boot into the BIOS/UEFI settings and verify:
   - All drives are detected.
   - The USB-C drive is still set as the primary boot device.

---

### **Step 2: Use Alternate Installer Options**
At the AlmaLinux boot menu (where you select "Install AlmaLinux"):
1. Highlight the **Install AlmaLinux** option and press **`e`** to edit its boot parameters.
2. Append the following to the end of the kernel boot line:
   ```
   inst.nokill inst.noshell
   ```
3. Press `Ctrl+X` to boot.

This prevents the installer from dropping to the `dracut` shell on errors, allowing the process to continue.

---

### **Step 3: Check for Hardware Issues**
1. **Disconnect Unnecessary Drives**:
   Disconnect all drives except:
   - The **1TB USB-C drive** (for the installer).
   - The **500GB SSD** (for installation).
2. **Reconnect All Cables**:
   Ensure all cables are securely connected to the drives and motherboard.

---

### **Step 4: Boot Into Rescue Mode**
If you can reboot and access the AlmaLinux installer menu:
1. Select **Troubleshooting > Rescue AlmaLinux**.
2. Use the rescue environment to check the drives and logs:
   - **List drives**:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```
   - **Check logs**:
     ```bash
     journalctl
     ```

---

### **Step 5: Recreate Boot Media**
If none of the above works, the ISO on the USB-C drive might be corrupted or improperly written:
1. Recreate the bootable drive with a fresh download of the AlmaLinux ISO.
2. Use a reliable tool like **Rufus** (Windows) or `dd` (Linux/macOS) to write the ISO.

---

Let me know if any of these steps help you get back on track. If the system still wonâ€™t respond to input, we may need to examine potential hardware issues or use an alternate installation method.

**USER**: The asus boot screen is showing a spinning circle

**ASSISTANT**: The ASUS boot screen with a spinning circle indicates that the system is trying to boot but is stuck or encountering an issue during the process. Letâ€™s troubleshoot step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Force a Reboot**
1. **Hold Down the Power Button** until the system powers off completely.
2. **Wait 10 Seconds** and turn it back on.
3. Boot into the BIOS/UEFI by pressing **Del**, **F2**, or the key indicated on the screen during startup.

---

### **Step 2: Check Boot Device Settings**
1. In the BIOS/UEFI:
   - Verify the **boot order**. Ensure the 1TB USB-C drive is set as the first boot device.
   - Check if all your drives (USB-C, SSD, HDDs) are detected in the **Storage/Devices** section.

2. **Save Changes and Exit**:
   - Save and exit the BIOS (usually **F10**).

---

### **Step 3: Boot into the Installer**
1. Once the system reboots:
   - If the installer boot menu appears, select **Install AlmaLinux**.
   - If it doesnâ€™t appear, re-enter the BIOS and confirm the boot device.

---

### **Step 4: Troubleshooting Installation Stuck Issues**
If the spinning circle persists:
1. **Reconnect Drives**:
   - Power off the system and physically disconnect all drives except:
     - The **1TB USB-C drive**.
     - The **500GB SSD** (target drive for installation).
   - Reboot and retry installation.

2. **Recreate Bootable Media**:
   - If the issue continues, the ISO might be corrupted or improperly written. Recreate the bootable USB-C drive with:
     - **Rufus** (Windows).
     - `dd` command (Linux/macOS):
       ```bash
       sudo dd if=/path/to/almalinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
       ```

---

### **Step 5: Test Boot Media**
If you suspect the USB-C drive is the problem, test it on another machine:
- Boot from the drive on a different system to confirm itâ€™s working.
- If it fails, re-download the ISO and recreate the bootable media.

---

### **Step 6: Use Alternate Boot Options**
At the installer boot menu:
1. Highlight the **Install AlmaLinux** option.
2. Press **`e`** to edit the boot parameters.
3. Append:
   ```
   inst.nokill inst.noshell
   ```
4. Press **Ctrl+X** to boot.

---

Let me know how these steps go, and weâ€™ll continue troubleshooting if needed!

**USER**: Itâ€™s checking dev/sdb

**ASSISTANT**: If the installer or system is checking **`/dev/sdb`**, itâ€™s likely performing a filesystem or device integrity check on your **2TB Seagate portable HDD** (or whichever drive is designated as `/dev/sdb` in your setup). Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

---

### **Step 1: Wait for the Check**
1. If itâ€™s a routine check (e.g., checking for bad sectors or mounting issues), allow it to complete.
   - The check may take a while depending on the size of the drive and its condition.
2. If the process is stuck for an extended period (e.g., over 10-15 minutes), proceed to the next steps.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Device**
To confirm what **`/dev/sdb`** is:
1. When the installer or boot reaches a shell prompt (like `dracut:#`), type:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   This will list all connected drives and their partitions. Look for **`/dev/sdb`** to see:
   - Its size.
   - If it has any partitions.

2. If the system is stuck and unresponsive, **reboot** and:
   - Disconnect all drives except for the **1TB USB-C drive** (installer) and **500GB SSD** (target).
   - Try the installer again to simplify the setup.

---

### **Step 3: Bypass the Check**
If the check is causing issues:
1. At the installer boot menu, edit the boot parameters:
   - Highlight **Install AlmaLinux** and press **`e`**.
   - Add the following to the end of the kernel line:
     ```
     rd.skipfsck
     ```
   - This skips filesystem checks during boot.

2. Press **Ctrl+X** to boot with the modified parameters.

---

### **Step 4: Prepare the Drive (Optional)**
If **`/dev/sdb`** is the 2TB Seagate HDD and itâ€™s causing errors:
1. Boot into **Rescue Mode** from the installer menu.
2. Use the following commands to check the drive:
   - **Filesystem Check**:
     ```bash
     fsck /dev/sdb
     ```
     If it reports errors, follow the prompts to repair them.
   - **Disk Health**:
     ```bash
     smartctl -a /dev/sdb
     ```
     This checks the driveâ€™s health. If the drive has bad sectors or other issues, it might need replacement.

3. Reformat the Drive (if necessary):
   ```bash
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
   ```
   Replace `ext4` with your desired filesystem (e.g., `xfs`).

---

### **Step 5: Retry Installation**
1. Reboot after addressing any issues with `/dev/sdb`.
2. If the installer still hangs on **`/dev/sdb`**, try disconnecting the 2TB HDD temporarily and proceed with the installation.

---

Let me know the status of **`/dev/sdb`**, and weâ€™ll adjust the approach as needed!

**USER**: Oh wait I think itâ€™s actually installing

**ASSISTANT**: That's fantastic news! If it's moving past the checks and actually installing, you're on the right track. Let the installer run its course, and we can proceed once it completes.

### During Installation:
- Watch for any prompts or errors that might require your input.
- If youâ€™re prompted about disk partitioning, ensure your 500GB SSD is selected as the installation target (weâ€™ll configure the 2TB and other drives later for data storage

**USER**: Yes ! It did

**ASSISTANT**: Great to hear the installation went through successfully! Now that AlmaLinux is installed, letâ€™s move forward step by step to configure everything properly.

---

### **Step 1: Log In and Update the System**
1. Boot into your freshly installed AlmaLinux system.
2. Log in with the username and password you created during installation.
3. Update the system to ensure you have the latest packages:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Check Disk Setup**
Weâ€™ll verify all connected drives are detected and identify their current state.
1. Run the following command to list all connected drives:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
2. Confirm that:
   - The 500GB SSD is your root (`/`) partition.
   - The 1TB USB-C drive and 2TB Seagate HDD are detected but not yet mounted.

---

### **Step 3: Partition Additional Drives**
Weâ€™ll now prepare your **1TB USB-C drive** and **2TB Seagate HDD**:
1. Launch the partitioning tool:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /

**ASSISTANT**: Let's get your AlmaLinux installation properly configured for your intended use case. We'll proceed step by step to ensure everything is set up correctly. Here's the roadmap:

---

### **Step 1: Post-Installation Basics**
1. **Log in as the Admin User** you created during installation.
2. **Update the System**:
   Run:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

3. **Install Essential Tools**:
   Install common utilities:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y vim nano wget curl git net-tools htop
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Configure the Disk Layout**
Now weâ€™ll partition and mount the drives for optimal usage:

1. **Verify All Drives**:
   Check connected drives:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   Identify the device names for your drives (e.g., `/dev/sda` for the 500GB SSD, `/dev/sdb` for the 2TB HDD, and `/dev/sdc` for the 1TB USB-C).

2. **Partition and Format Additional

**ASSISTANT**: No worries at all! Let the installation complete fully before we move forward. Once itâ€™s done, follow the on-screen instructions to reboot the system and log in. Let me know when you're ready, and weâ€™ll continue with the setup from there!

**USER**: I am on the welcome to almalinux 9.5 install screen where I select language

**ASSISTANT**: Perfect, you're at the beginning of the configuration stage! Follow these steps to move through the AlmaLinux installation process smoothly. Let me know after completing each step so we can proceed together.

---

### **Step 1: Language Selection**
1. Select your preferred language (e.g., English (United States)) and click **Continue**.

---

### **Step 2: Installation Summary**
You'll now see the **Installation Summary** screen. Hereâ€™s what to configure:

#### **2.1: Keyboard**
1. Click **Keyboard** and verify the layout.

   - Click **Done** to return.

#### **2.3: Software Selection**
1. Click **Software Selection**.
   - Choose **Server with GUI** for ease of management (or another option if you prefer a minimal installation).
   - Click **Done**.

#### **2.4: Installation Destination**
1. Click **Installation Destination**.
2. Select the **500GB SSD** as the target drive (ensure it is checked).
3. Choose **Custom Partitioning** to create a more tailored layout:
   - **/boot**: 1GB (ext4)
   - **/swap**: 8GB (or match your RAM size, unless you plan to hibernate).
   - **/** (root): 50GB (xfs).
   - Remaining space: Allocate for **/var** or additional needs.
   - Leave your other drives unallocated for now (we'll configure them later).

4. Click **Done**, review the partition layout, and click **Accept Changes**.

#### **2.5: Network & Hostname**
1. Click **Network & Hostname**.
   - Enable your network adapter and configure a hostname (e.g., `omniversal-server.local`).
   - Click **Done**.

---

### **Step 3: Begin Installation**
1. Once all options are configured, click **Begin Installation**.

#### During Installation:
- Set a **root password**.
- Create a standard **user account** with administrative privileges.

---

Let me know when the installation finishes or if you encounter any issues along the way!

**USER**: Wait I thought we need to partition all of the drives at install?

**ASSISTANT**: You're absolutely right! If you'd like to partition **all the drives** during the installation process, we can definitely do that now. This allows you to plan and organize your storage layout upfront, especially since `/var` and other partitions need ample space for your web/cloud data. Letâ€™s outline how to partition all your drives during installation.

---

### **Partitioning Strategy**
Hereâ€™s the plan based on your system:
1. **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**: For the operating system and root directory (`/`).
2. **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)**: For web/cloud data (`/var/www` or similar).
3. **2TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)**: For media storage, backups, or other large data directories.

---

### **Step-by-Step Partitioning at Install**

1. **Select All Drives in "Installation Destination"**:
   - On the **Installation Destination** screen, select **all three drives** (500GB SSD, 1TB USB-C, and 2TB HDD).
   - Choose **Custom Partitioning**.

2. **Create Partitions for Each Drive**:
   #### For the **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**:
   - **/boot**: 1GB (ext4).
   - **/swap**: 8GB (match your RAM size unless hibernating).
   - **/** (root): 50GB (xfs or ext4).
   - Remaining space: Allocate for **/home** (xfs or ext4).

   #### For the **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)**:
   - Create one large partition and mount it to **/var/www** (or just `/var` if you want to include logs and other data).

   #### For the **2TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)**:
   - Create one large partition and mount it to **/mnt/media** (or another directory for your media and backup needs).

3. **Set Filesystems**:
   - Use **ext4** or **xfs** for all partitions. Both are reliable, but **xfs** is often better for large data storage like `/var`.

4. **Review and Accept Changes**:
   - Click **Done** and review the partition layout.
   - Accept the changes to proceed.

---

### **Key Considerations**:
- **Future Drives**: Youâ€™re planning to add more storage later (e.g., 5TB HDD, 1TB SSD). Weâ€™ll configure those post-installation.
- **Flexible Mount Points**: If you're unsure where to mount certain drives now, we can adjust them after the installation using `fstab`.

---

Let me know if you want to make any tweaks to this layout or have questions about specific partitions!

**USER**: When I configure the root password do I check the box for lock root account and allow root ssh login with password?

**ASSISTANT**: Here's what each option does and how to decide based on your setup:

---

### **1. Lock Root Account**
- **What it Does**: Disables direct login as the root user, even with the correct password. Youâ€™d have to log in as a regular user and use `sudo` to perform administrative tasks.
- **Recommendation**: 
  - **Yes, lock the root account** if security is a priority and you prefer to use `sudo` for administration.
  - **No, do not lock** if you need direct root access frequently (e.g., during server configuration). However, it's best to disable it later for better security.

---

### **2. Allow Root SSH Login with Password**
- **What it Does**: Enables the root user to log in remotely via SSH using a password.
- **Recommendation**:
  - **Do NOT allow root SSH login with a password** unless absolutely necessary. This is a common attack vector. Instead:
    - Use SSH key-based authentication for root (more secure).
    - Log in with a regular user and use `sudo` for administrative tasks.

---

### **Suggested Configuration**:
- Check **Lock Root Account** to disable direct root login.
- Do **NOT** check **Allow Root SSH Login with Password** for better security.

---

If youâ€™re still unsure or have specific needs, let me know, and we can adjust based on your intended use case!

**USER**: Can I just leave both unchecked?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can leave both **unchecked** if you prefer. Here's what that means:

1. **Not Locking the Root Account**:
   - Youâ€™ll have direct access to the `root` account both locally and via SSH (if SSH is installed and configured).
   - This is fine during initial setup, as it simplifies troubleshooting. However, you should consider locking the root account later for better security.

2. **Not Allowing Root SSH Login with Password**:
   - Root SSH login will not be explicitly restricted. However, you can manage this later by editing your SSH configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to disable password-based logins or restrict root access.

---

### **Recommendation for Initial Setup**:
- Leave **both unchecked** during installation for flexibility.
- After the setup is complete and the server is running:
  - Secure the system by locking the root account or restricting SSH access to root.

---

Let me know how it goes or if you'd like guidance on hardening security after the installation!

**USER**: Do I create a user?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you should **create a user account** during the installation process. This user will be your main non-root administrative account and will allow you to securely perform tasks without directly logging in as `root`.

---

### **Why Create a User?**
1. **Security**: Logging in as a standard user and using `sudo` for administrative tasks minimizes the risk of accidental or malicious changes.
2. **Best Practices**: Most modern Linux systems recommend working with a non-root user to keep the system secure.

---

### **Steps to Create a User During Installation**:
1. Enter the following details:
   - **Full Name**: Enter your preferred name (e.g., `Hawk Eye`).
   - **Username**: Choose a short username (e.g., `hawk` or `hawkeye`).
   - **Password**: Set a strong password for this user.

2. **Grant Administrative Privileges**:
   - Check the box for **"Make this user administrator"**.
   - This gives the user access to `sudo`, allowing them to perform administrative tasks when needed.

---

### **Post-Installation Tip**:
After installation, you can log in as this user and perform almost all tasks using `sudo`. Youâ€™ll rarely need to log in as `root`.

---

Let me know once the user is created, and weâ€™ll continue!

**USER**: Now ready for installation destination steps

**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's carefully configure the **Installation Destination** to set up your drives and partitions. Follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Open Installation Destination**
1. Click **Installation Destination** on the main installation summary screen.
2. Under **Storage Configuration**:
   - Select **Custom** to manually configure the partitions.

3. Make sure all drives are listed (500GB SSD, 1TB USB-C, 2TB HDD).

---

### **Step 2: Select Drives**
1. Check the boxes for all three drives:
   - **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**
   - **1TB USB-C (`/dev/sdb`)**
   - **2TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)**

2. Click **Done** to proceed to the custom partitioning screen.

---

### **Step 3: Configure Partitions**
For each drive, weâ€™ll set up partitions:

#### **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)** (System Drive)
- **Partition 1**: **/boot**
  - Size: 1GB
  - Filesystem: ext4
- **Partition 2**: **swap**
  - Size: 8GB (match your RAM size unless using hibernation; otherwise, double RAM size).
- **Partition 3**: **/** (root)
  - Size: 50GB
  - Filesystem: xfs or ext4.
- **Partition 4**: **/home**
  - Size: Remaining space on the SSD.
  - Filesystem: xfs or ext4.

---

#### **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)** (Web/Cloud Data)
- Create one large partition:
  - Mount Point: **/var/www** (for web data like Drupal and Nextcloud).
  - Filesystem: xfs or ext4.
  - Use the entire drive for this partition.

---

#### **2TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)** (Media/Backups)
- Create one large partition:
  - Mount Point: **/mnt/media** (or a custom directory like `/media`).
  - Filesystem: xfs or ext4.
  - Use the entire drive.

---

### **Step 4: Review and Save**
1. Click **Done** to review your partitioning setup.
2. If everything looks correct, click **Accept Changes**.

---

### **Step 5: Finalize Installation Destination**
Once partitioning is complete, youâ€™ll return to the installation summary screen. Confirm that the selected drives are correct.

---

Let me know when youâ€™ve set up the partitions or if you need help with any specific step!

**USER**: My 2 Tb seagate is not shown

**ASSISTANT**: If your 2TB Seagate drive is not showing up in the **Installation Destination**, it likely means the system is not detecting the drive during the installation process. Letâ€™s troubleshoot this step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Verify Drive Connection**
1. **Power Off** your system.
2. **Check the Physical Connection**:
   - Ensure the 2TB Seagate drive is securely plugged into a working USB port or SATA port (depending on its type).
   - Try connecting it to a different USB port or cable.

3. **Power On** the system and return to the Installation Destination screen.

---

### **Step 2: Re-scan for Drives**
If the drive still isnâ€™t showing:
1. In the **Installation Destination** screen, look for a **Re-scan** or **Refresh** option and click it.
2. If this doesnâ€™t work, open a terminal from the installer:
   - Press **Ctrl+Alt+F2** to access the terminal.
   - Run the following commands to check connected drives:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     fdisk -l
     ```
   - Look for `/dev/sdc` or a device matching the size of your 2TB Seagate drive.

---

### **Step 3: Check Drive Status**
1. If the drive appears in the terminal but not in the installer:
   - It may have an unsupported partition table. Run:
     ```bash
     parted /dev/sdc
     ```
   - Recreate the partition table if necessary:
     ```bash
     mklabel gpt
     ```
2. If the drive does not appear at all:
   - The drive may have hardware issues. Try testing it on another computer to ensure it works.

---

### **Step 4: Retry Installation**
1. Return to the installer by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+F1**.
2. Reopen the **Installation Destination** and see if the drive is now detected.

---

### **Next Steps**
If the drive still isnâ€™t showing:
- Let me know what you see in the terminal outputs from `lsblk` and `fdisk -l`.
- If you suspect a hardware issue, we can explore options for testing or formatting the drive outside the installer.

**USER**: How do I get back to the installer?

**ASSISTANT**: To return to the AlmaLinux installer interface from the terminal, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Return to the Installer**
1. Press **Ctrl+Alt+F6** or **Ctrl+Alt+F1**:
   - The installer usually runs on one of these virtual terminals.
   - Keep trying **F1â€“F7** (while holding **Ctrl+Alt**) if the installer doesnâ€™t immediately appear.

---

### **Step 2: Refresh the Installer**
Once youâ€™re back in the installer:
1. Go to the **Installation Destination** screen.
2. Look for a **Re-scan or Refresh** button (if available) to detect drives again.

---

### **Step 3: If It Doesn't Work**
If pressing **Ctrl+Alt+F6** or similar doesn't bring the installer back:
1. Reboot your system:
   - Hold the **power button** to force a shutdown if necessary.
2. Start the installation process again by booting from the 1TB USB-C drive.

---

Let me know if youâ€™re able to get back to the installer or if you need further assistance!

**USER**: Iâ€™m going to skip it for now - letâ€™s move forward with just the three drives - 500Gb SSD - 1TB SSD usb c with installation media on it - the 3 TB HDD 

**ASSISTANT**: Got it! Letâ€™s move forward with the **500GB SSD**, **1TB USB-C**, and **3TB HDD** for now. We can always add the 2TB Seagate drive later after installation. Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll proceed:

---

### **Partitioning Strategy**
#### **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)** (System Drive)
- **/boot**: 1GB (ext4)
- **swap**: 8GB (match your RAM size unless you plan to hibernate; otherwise, double the RAM size).
- **/** (root): 50GB (xfs or ext4)
- **/home**: Remaining space on the SSD (xfs or ext4)

#### **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)** (Web/Cloud Data)
- Create one large partition:
  - Mount Point: **/var/www** (or `/var` if you want to include logs and other data).
  - Filesystem: xfs or ext4
  - Use the entire drive for this partition.

#### **3TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)** (Media/Backups)
- Create one large partition:
  - Mount Point: **/mnt/media** (or another directory for your media and backup needs).
  - Filesystem: xfs or ext4
  - Use the entire drive.

---

### **Steps to Configure Installation Destination**
1. Go to **Installation Destination** and select **Custom Partitioning**.
2. Select the **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)** for system partitions:
   - **Add Mount Point** `/boot`: 1GB (ext4).
   - **Add Mount Point** `swap`: 8GB.
   - **Add Mount Point** `/` (root): 50GB (xfs or ext4).
   - **Add Mount Point** `/home`: Use the remaining space.

3. Select the **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)**:
   - **Add Mount Point** `/var/www`: Use the entire drive (xfs or ext4).

4. Select the **3TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)**:
   - **Add Mount Point** `/mnt/media`: Use the entire drive (xfs or ext4).

5. Click **Done**, review the partition layout, and **Accept Changes**.

---

### **Begin Installation**
Once the partitions are set, click **Begin Installation**:
- Set your **root password** and create the **user account** as we discussed earlier.

---

Let me know once the installation begins or if you have any questions!

**USER**: Take me through it one by one

**ASSISTANT**: Got itâ€”letâ€™s proceed step by step for configuring the **Installation Destination**.

---

### **Step 1: Open Installation Destination**
1. From the **Installation Summary** screen, click on **Installation Destination**.

2. Under **Storage Configuration**, select **Custom** (to manually configure your partitions).

3. Ensure all three drives are selected:
   - **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**
   - **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)**
   - **3TB HDD (`/dev/sdc`)**

4. Click **Done** to proceed to the **Manual Partitioning** screen.

---

### **Step 2: Configure the 500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**
1. Select the **500GB SSD** from the list of drives.

2. Create the following partitions:
   #### Partition 1: `/boot`
   - Click **+** to add a new partition.
   - **Mount Point**: `/boot`
   - **Desired Capacity**: `1 GiB`
   - **Filesystem**: `ext4`
   - Click **Add Mount Point**.

   #### Partition 2: `swap`
   - Click **+** to add another partition.
   - **Mount Point**: `swap` (choose from the dropdown).
   - **Desired Capacity**: `8 GiB` (match your RAM).
   - Click **Add Mount Point**.

   #### Partition 3: `/` (root)
   - Click **+** to add another partition.
   - **Mount Point**: `/`
   - **Desired Capacity**: `50 GiB`
   - **Filesystem**: `xfs` or `ext4`
   - Click **Add Mount Point**.

   #### Partition 4: `/home`
   - Click **+** to add the final partition for this drive.
   - **Mount Point**: `/home`
   - Use the **Remaining Space**.
   - **Filesystem**: `xfs` or `ext4`
   - Click **Add Mount Point**.

3. Review your changes and ensure the partitions match the plan.

---

### **Step 3: Confirm and Let Me Know**
After completing the partitioning for the **500GB SSD**, click **Done** and confirm the changes for this drive. Let me know when youâ€™ve finished this part, and weâ€™ll move on to the **1TB USB-C Drive (`/dev/sdb`)**!

**USER**: Oh wow! I see what I did wrong - I mistakenly wrote the ISO to the 2 TB Seagate drive instead and thatâ€™s why it wonâ€™t show

**ASSISTANT**: Ah, that makes perfect sense! If the ISO was mistakenly written to the **2TB Seagate drive**, it overwrote its partition table, making it appear as installation media rather than a storage drive. We can fix this after installation by reformatting the drive and setting it up properly.

For now, letâ€™s move forward with the three available drives: **500GB SSD**, **1TB USB-C**, and **3TB HDD.** Once AlmaLinux is installed, weâ€™ll handle the **2TB Seagate drive**.

---

### **Next Step: Partition the 500GB SSD**
Letâ€™s ensure weâ€™ve configured the **500GB SSD** for the system partitions as outlined before. 

1. On the **Manual Partitioning** screen, select the **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**.
2. Set up the partitions:
   - **/boot**: 1GB
   - **swap**: 8GB
   - **/** (root): 50GB
   - **/home**: Remaining space

Once youâ€™ve set this up, click **Done** and confirm your changes.

---

Let me know when this is complete, and weâ€™ll move on to partitioning the **1TB USB-C drive**!

**USER**: Standard partitioning?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can use **standard partitioning** for this setup unless you specifically want to use **LVM** (Logical Volume Management) or **BTRFS** for advanced features. Standard partitioning is simpler, easier to manage, and perfectly fine for your requirements. Here's how:

---

### **Step 1: Use Standard Partitioning**
When setting up partitions, choose **Standard Partitioning** (not LVM or BTRFS) for each of the partitions.

---

### **Why Use Standard Partitioning?**
- **Simple to Configure**: Easy to create, modify, and manage partitions.
- **Ideal for Your Use Case**: Perfect for a setup with distinct drives for system, web/cloud data, and media storage.
- **Direct Mount Points**: Each partition gets a specific mount point (e.g., `/`, `/var/www`), which is straightforward.

---

### **Summary for the 500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)**
Under **Standard Partitioning**, create:
1. `/boot`: 1GB, ext4.
2. `swap`: 8GB.
3. `/`: 50GB, xfs or ext4.
4. `/home`: Remaining space, xfs or ext4.

---

Let me know once youâ€™ve created these, and weâ€™ll move to the next drive!

**USER**: Well damn itâ€™s frozen on me somehow 

**ASSISTANT**: No worriesâ€”this happens occasionally during installations. Letâ€™s troubleshoot and get you back on track.

---

### **Step 1: Force Restart**
1. Hold the **power button** on your system until it shuts down completely.
2. Wait a few seconds, then power it back on.

---

### **Step 2: Boot into the Installer Again**
1. When the system starts, ensure the **1TB USB-C drive** is selected as the boot device in the BIOS/UEFI.
2. Boot back into the AlmaLinux installer.

---

### **Step 3: Resume Installation**
1. When you reach the **Installation Destination** screen again, reselect the **Custom Partitioning** option.
2. Recreate the partitions for the **500GB SSD (`/dev/sda`)** as we discussed earlier.

---

### **If the Installer Freezes Again**
1. Use **Troubleshooting Mode**:
   - From the installerâ€™s main menu, select **Troubleshooting**.
   - Choose **Install AlmaLinux in Basic Graphics Mode**.
   - This can help bypass any graphical glitches causing the freeze.

2. **Check Logs**:
   - If it freezes at the same point, access a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F2) and check the logs:
     ```bash
     journalctl -xe
     ```

3. **Disconnect Other Drives**:
   - Temporarily disconnect the **1TB USB-C drive** (except for installation media) and the **3TB HDD**. Just use the **500GB SSD** to simplify the setup and add the other drives later.

---

Let me know what happens after restarting or if you need further guidance!

**USER**: Iâ€™m going to go to sleep and wake up and dedicate a chunk of my time in the morning to this or wait - what did the schedule you made for me say to do in the mornings before work?

**ASSISTANT**: User plans to dedicate a chunk of time in the mornings to focus on setting up their server before work.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Your morning schedule before work, as we've discussed, is focused on progressing with high-priority tasks like your server setup or creative projects. Starting fresh with a clear mind will help you troubleshoot efficiently.
