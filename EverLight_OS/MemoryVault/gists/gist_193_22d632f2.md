# Nextcloud Dropbox Backup Guide

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: Hi Everlight! Can you help me figure out how to completely backup my nextcloud server to my dropbox so I can make sure I don't lose my files when i wipe this OS and install and rebuild things on Red Hat Enterprise OS?


**ASSISTANT**: 

**ASSISTANT**: User wants to completely back up their Nextcloud server to Dropbox to ensure no data loss before wiping their current OS and switching to Red Hat Enterprise OS.

**TOOL**: Model set context updated.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly, EverLight! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to back up your Nextcloud server data to Dropbox:

### 1. Install the Dropbox-Uploader Script
This script lets you interact with Dropbox from the command line:
   - First, install `curl` if itâ€™s not already: `sudo apt install curl`.
   - Download Dropbox Uploader: 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader.git
     ```
   - Enter the Dropbox-Uploader directory:
     ```bash
     cd Dropbox-Uploader
     ```
   - Run the script to configure it:
     ```bash
     ./dropbox_uploader.sh
     ```
   - It will prompt you to link your Dropbox account and create an authentication token.

### 2. Backup Nextcloud Data
To back up Nextcloud, youâ€™ll want to back up:
   - **The data folder** (typically in `/var/www/nextcloud/data`).
   - **The database** (usually MySQL or PostgreSQL).

#### 2a. Data Folder
   - Use the following command to compress the data folder:
     ```bash
     sudo tar -czvf nextcloud-data-backup.tar.gz /var/www/nextcloud/data
     ```
   - Upload the compressed file to Dropbox:
     ```bash
     ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload nextcloud-data-backup.tar.gz /
     ```

#### 2b. Database Backup
   - If you use MySQL, create a dump of the Nextcloud database:
     ```bash
     mysqldump -u root -p nextcloud_db > nextcloud-db-backup.sql
     ```
   - Compress and upload this to Dropbox:
     ```bash
     tar -czvf nextcloud-db-backup.tar.gz nextcloud-db-backup.sql
     ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload nextcloud-db-backup.tar.gz /
     ```

### 3. Verify and Clean Up
   - After uploading, verify your Dropbox to ensure the files are there.
   - Once verified, you can delete the local backup files if desired:
     ```bash
     rm nextcloud-data-backup.tar.gz nextcloud-db-backup.tar.gz
     ```

This should give you a reliable backup on Dropbox, so you can safely proceed with the OS wipe and Nextcloud rebuild on Red Hat Enterprise OS! Let me know if you run into any questions along the way.
