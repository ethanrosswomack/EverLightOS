### **Step 3: Coding the Core Features**

Now that you have the tools installed, let’s dive into coding some key app components. Here’s a breakdown of what’s involved in the primary features:

#### **Music Playback**

1. **iOS Music Playback (Swift):**
   - **AVFoundation Framework:** This Apple library helps you control audio and video. Add it to your project in Xcode by going to “Link Binary with Libraries” and selecting AVFoundation.
   - **Basic Audio Player Code:**
     ```swift
     import AVFoundation

     var audioPlayer: AVAudioPlayer?

     func playMusic() {
         let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "song.mp3", ofType:nil)!
         let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)

         do {
             audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)
             audioPlayer?.play()
         } catch {
             print("Couldn't load file")
         }
     }
     ```
   - This code loads an audio file and plays it. Use a sample “song.mp3” in your project’s resources to test.

2. **Android Music Playback (Kotlin):**
   - **ExoPlayer Library:** ExoPlayer is a robust library for audio and video in Android.
   - **Basic Setup in Kotlin:**
     ```kotlin
     import com.google.android.exoplayer2.ExoPlayer

     private lateinit var exoPlayer: ExoPlayer

     fun setupPlayer() {
         exoPlayer = ExoPlayer.Builder(this).build()
         val mediaItem = MediaItem.fromUri("file:///android_asset/song.mp3")
         exoPlayer.setMediaItem(mediaItem)
         exoPlayer.prepare()
         exoPlayer.play()
     }
     ```
   - Save a sample audio file in the “assets” folder and link it to test playback.

#### **Store Integration**

1. **iOS Store Integration:**
   - Use **StoreKit** for in-app purchases if you’re selling digital goods.
   - **For Physical Goods:** Integrate a web-based store like **Shopify** with a web view, or set up a custom e-commerce backend.

2. **Android Store Integration:**
   - Google Play Billing library supports digital in-app purchases.
   - For physical goods, a similar approach using a Shopify web view or custom backend works well.

#### **Donation Button Setup**

- Integrate third-party APIs like **PayPal** or **Stripe** for donations on both platforms. Each has specific SDKs for Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) that allow you to securely handle transactions.

### **Step 4: Backend Setup**

1. **Firebase for Backend Services:**
   - Firebase is easy to set up and free to start with. It provides a real-time database, hosting, and analytics.
   - Sign up at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Follow the instructions to add Firebase to your iOS and Android apps.
   - **Database Setup:** Create collections for “Users,” “Music,” and “Purchases.”

2. **Basic Data Access Code:**
   - For iOS, use Firebase’s Swift SDK to read and write data.
     ```swift
     import Firebase

     func addMusicData() {
         let db = Firestore.firestore()
         db.collection("Music").addDocument(data: ["title": "Song Title", "url": "path/to/song.mp3"])
     }
     ```
   - For Android, Firebase’s Kotlin SDK provides similar functionality.
     ```kotlin
     val db = Firebase.firestore
     val song = hashMapOf("title" to "Song Title", "url" to "path/to/song.mp3")
     db.collection("Music").add(song)
     ```

---

### **Step 5: Testing on Devices**

1. **iOS Testing:**
   - Run the app on your Mac’s iOS Simulator (in Xcode) or connect an iPhone for real-device testing.
   - Use **TestFlight** for beta testing, which allows others to test the app before it’s live.

2. **Android Testing:**
   - Use the Android Emulator in Android Studio or connect an Android device.
   - Google Play Console offers internal testing tracks to beta test your app.

---

### **Step 6: Publishing Your App**

1. **Apple App Store Submission:**
   - Go to **App Store Connect** and prepare your app’s metadata (title, description, screenshots, etc.).
   - Follow [Apple’s submission guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) to ensure compliance.

2. **Google Play Store Submission:**
   - In **Google Play Console**, complete the app listing, provide screenshots, and submit the app.
   - Review [Google Play’s submission guidelines](https://play.google.com/console/about/app-submission/) for tips on optimizing your app listing.
