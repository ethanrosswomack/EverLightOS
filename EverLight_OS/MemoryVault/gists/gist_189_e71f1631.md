# Web server setup Fedora

**SYSTEM**: 

**USER**: okay so i'm going to try now to set things up on this machine instead - it's running the latest fedora workstation desktop os - can you guide me through the full setup of all my intended webservers/domains/apps etc?

**TOOL**: **Mapping out the setup**

I'm pulling together a comprehensive guide for setting up webservers, domains, and apps on Fedora Workstation. It includes installing necessary packages, configuring webservers like Apache or Nginx, setting up domains, configuring DNS, SSL certificates, and deploying web applications, with a touch on firewall and security setup.

**Readying the web server**

Iâ€™m gathering details on setting up a Fedora web server. This includes installing packages, configuring web servers like Apache, managing DNS, and securing with SSL certificates.

**ASSISTANT**: Setting up a comprehensive web server environment on Fedora Workstation involves several steps, including installing and configuring web servers, setting up domains, securing your sites, and deploying applications. Below is a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you through the entire process.

---

## **1. System Preparation**

### **a. Update Your System**
Before starting, ensure your system is up-to-date.

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf upgrade -y
```

### **b. Install Essential Tools**
Install tools that will help you manage the system and troubleshoot if needed.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y vim git curl wget
```

---

## **2. Install a Web Server**

You have two popular choices for web servers: **Apache** and **Nginx**. This guide will cover both, so you can choose based on your preference.

### **a. Installing Apache**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y httpd
```

#### **Start and Enable Apache**

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

#### **Configure Firewall for Apache**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### **b. Installing Nginx**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y nginx
```

#### **Start and Enable Nginx**

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

#### **Configure Firewall for Nginx**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

*Choose either Apache or Nginx based on your requirements. For this guide, I'll proceed with Apache, but the steps are similar for Nginx.*

---

## **3. Install and Configure PHP (Optional)**

If you plan to run PHP-based applications (like WordPress), install PHP and related modules.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y php php-mysqlnd php-fpm
```

#### **Configure PHP for Apache**

Edit the PHP configuration file to work with Apache.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/php.ini
```

Ensure the following lines are set (uncommented if necessary):

```ini
cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
```

#### **Restart Apache**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

---

## **4. Install and Configure a Database Server**

Depending on your application, you might need a database server like **MariaDB** or **PostgreSQL**. Here's how to install MariaDB.

### **a. Install MariaDB**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y mariadb-server
```

### **b. Start and Enable MariaDB**

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

### **c. Secure MariaDB Installation**

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to set a root password and secure your installation.

---

## **5. Set Up Your Domain Names**

Assuming you have registered domain names, you'll need to point them to your server's IP address.

### **a. Configure DNS Records**

1. **A Record**: Point your domain (e.g., `example.com`) and subdomains (e.g., `www.example.com`) to your server's public IP address.

   - **Host**: `@` and `www`
   - **Type**: `A`
   - **Value**: `Your_Server_IP`

2. **CNAME Record**: Optionally, for subdomains pointing to other domains.

   - **Host**: `blog`
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Value**: `example.com`

*Note: DNS changes can take up to 24-48 hours to propagate, but usually, they update within a few hours.*

---

## **6. Configure Virtual Hosts**

Virtual Hosts allow you to host multiple domains on a single server.

### **a. Create Directory Structure**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/public_html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/anotherdomain.com/public_html
```

### **b. Set Permissions**

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/public_html
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/anotherdomain.com/public_html

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
```

### **c. Create Sample Pages**

```bash
echo "<html><head><title>Welcome to Example.com</title></head><body><h1>Success! The example.com virtual host is working!</h1></body></html>" | sudo tee /var/www/example.com/public_html/index.html

echo "<html><head><title>Welcome to AnotherDomain.com</title></head><body><h1>Success! The anotherdomain.com virtual host is working!</h1></body></html>" | sudo tee /var/www/anotherdomain.com/public_html/index.html
```

### **d. Create Virtual Host Files**

#### **For Apache:**

Create a new configuration file for each domain.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/example.com.conf
```

Add the following content:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog /var/www/example.com/error.log
    CustomLog /var/www/example.com/requests.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Repeat for `anotherdomain.com`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/anotherdomain.com.conf
```

Add:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName anotherdomain.com
    ServerAlias www.anotherdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/anotherdomain.com/public_html
    ErrorLog /var/www/anotherdomain.com/error.log
    CustomLog /var/www/anotherdomain.com/requests.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

### **e. Test Apache Configuration and Restart**

```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
```

If syntax is OK, restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

---

## **7. Secure Your Websites with SSL Certificates**

Use **Let's Encrypt** to obtain free SSL certificates.

### **a. Install Certbot**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

### **b. Obtain and Install SSL Certificates**

```bash
sudo certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com
sudo certbot --apache -d anotherdomain.com -d www.anotherdomain.com
```

Follow the interactive prompts to complete the SSL installation. Certbot will automatically configure Apache to use the certificates.

### **c. Test Automatic Renewal**

Certbot sets up a cron job for automatic renewal. Test it with:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

---

## **8. Deploy Your Applications**

Depending on the type of applications you intend to run (e.g., WordPress, Node.js apps), the deployment steps will vary. Below is a general approach for deploying a PHP application like WordPress.

### **a. Install PHP Extensions (if not already installed)**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y php php-mysqlnd php-xml php-gd php-curl php-zip
```

### **b. Download and Extract the Application**

For WordPress:

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com/public_html
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
mv wordpress/* .
rm -rf wordpress latest.tar.gz
```

### **c. Configure the Application**

Create a configuration file (e.g., `wp-config.php` for WordPress).

```bash
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
vim wp-config.php
```

Set the database name, user, and password:

```php
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
define('DB_USER', 'your_database_user');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_database_password');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
```

### **d. Create a Database for the Application**

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

Within the MySQL shell:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_db;
CREATE USER 'example_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON example_db.* TO 'example_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

### **e. Finalize Installation via Web Interface**

Navigate to `https://example.com` in your browser and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

---

## **9. Configure Firewall and Security**

### **a. Ensure Firewall Allows Necessary Traffic**

If you followed earlier steps, HTTP and HTTPS should already be allowed. Verify with:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

### **b. Install and Configure Fail2Ban (Optional)**

To protect against brute-force attacks.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y fail2ban
```

#### **Start and Enable Fail2Ban**

```bash
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```

#### **Configure Fail2Ban**

Create a local configuration file:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Adjust settings as needed, such as enabling protection for SSH and Apache.

---

## **10. Set Up Domain Name System (DNS) Properly**

Ensure your DNS records are correctly pointing to your server. Use tools like `dig` or online services like [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify DNS propagation.

```bash
dig example.com +short
dig www.example.com +short
```

---

## **11. Regular Maintenance and Monitoring**

### **a. Enable Automatic Updates (Optional but Recommended)**

Fedora doesn't enable automatic updates by default. You can set up `dnf-automatic` for this.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y dnf-automatic
sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer
```

### **b. Monitor Logs**

Regularly check web server logs for any issues.

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/www/example.com/error.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log
```

### **c. Backup Your Data**

Implement regular backups of your websites, databases, and configurations. Tools like `rsync`, `tar`, or backup solutions like **Duplicity** can be useful.

---

## **12. Additional Configurations (Optional)**

Depending on your needs, you might consider:

- **Version Control Integration**: Use Git to manage your application code.
  
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y git
  cd /var/www/example.com/public_html
  git init
  ```

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

- **Containerization**: Use Docker for isolating applications.

- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Install CMS platforms like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla.

- **Performance Enhancements**: Implement caching with tools like Varnish or use PHP accelerators like OPcache.

---
